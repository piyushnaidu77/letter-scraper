kurstboy,peter-hujars-day,Peter Hujar's Day,2025,2025-11-09,3.5,in love with how gracefully this breaks the 4th wall. such a pivotal detail in what could be (has been) easily dismissed as a pretty looking podcast. thinking more about the use of sunlight and how it turns into just a sliver that’s keeping the film alive and visible.. so beautiful. it also has such a great sense of playfulness and humor (like passages) that breaks down all those self-serious expectations you expect from it off the bat. still piecing together why i bought both milk duds AND popcorn for this *checks watch* 76 min long movie?

It's a really great concept for a story, but it feels thoroughly underdeveloped. I wanted to learn more about who Billi is as a person, get more scenes exploring the cultural differences between America and China, and really see the main conflict and the ethics surrounding it get explored and fleshed out to a greater degree.

schaffrillas,arrival-2016,Arrival,2016,2019-06-10T16:53:16.751Z,3.5,"A really intriguing and well-crafted sci-fi mystery. Denis Villeneuve is such a master of his craft that it's truly astounding, and I love how this movie takes its time to establish how difficult it would be to communicate with an alien race. Amy Adams is excellent as always as well. But not every scene felt necessary to me and it kinda dragged on at some parts. Still, one of the better sci-fi films in recent years"
schaffrillas,rocketman-2019,Rocketman,2019,2019-06-09T00:13:00.974Z,3.0,"While BoRap was one straight line of quality, this film is one of soaring highs and dull lows. Anytime it goes into a musical sequence, it's enthralling with amazing filmmaking and performances. Anytime it isn't, it's...kind of dull? There's some good drama towards the end but for the most part I was just kinda waiting for the next musical number the whole time.Still better than BoRap"

schaffrillas,star-wars-episode-i-the-phantom-menace,Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace,1999,2019-06-04T00:58:27.140Z,2.0,"More fun than I remember. The environments and characters either look really good or hysterically bad. Jar Jar and Anakin are annoying but in an amusing sort of way. Watto, Nute Gunray, and Boss Nass are all comedy goldmines. It really is just one of those so bad, it's good movies; all of its blunders are either hilarious or endearing, and I had a great time rewatching it."
schaffrillas,booksmart,Booksmart,2019,2019-05-30,4.0,"Plays like a mix of Lady Bird and The Nice Guys, which is a surprisingly good combo. So utterly fun and enjoyable with some hilarious characters, great direction, and amazing editing. Some characters could've been set up better and the ending kinda confused me but suffice to say I can't wait to see this again"
schaffrillas,spider-man-into-the-spider-verse,Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,2018,2019-05-29T15:59:41.580Z,5.0,I can't think of another movie that genuinely gets better and better on repeat viewings to this extent. Wow.
schaffrillas,coco-2017,Coco,2017,2019-05-29T05:00:56.994Z,4.0,"Kinda flawed in the story department in a lot of ways but I honestly don't care. This is a beautiful love letter to Mexican culture and a great musical to boot. The characters are super endearing and the complex interwoven backstory holds up so well on repeat viewings. It also has the best ending of any Pixar film, period."
schaffrillas,zootopia,Zootopia,2016,2019-05-27T15:29:35.865Z,3.5,"The Shakira song is laughably terrible but I like this movie a lot otherwise. Great dynamic between the two main characters and some interesting, mature themes for a kids movie. I wish the story was a little more engaging but still very intriguing and fun"
schaffrillas,inside-out-2015,Inside Out,2015,2019-05-27T01:49:42.863Z,4.0,"Creativity overload, in a good way. The story isn't great and the plot holes are pretty problematic but this movie's so engaging and fun that it doesn't matter. There are so many funny, expressive, heartfelt moments and characters that make this film an absolute Joy to revisit. It's not one of Pixar's absolute best, but it's pretty close."
schaffrillas,big-hero-6,Big Hero 6,2014,2019-05-26T05:07:25.200Z,2.5,"THAT WAS HIS MISTAKEIf it wasn't for Baymax this movie would legitimately bore me out of my mind. It's really lame as a superhero movie and a Disney movie, and I hate T.J. Miller in this sooooooo much. But y'know it's not awful or anything. Just...10 years behind the curve. Actually, scratch that, Pixar made The Incredibles 10 years before this came out so it's more like 15 or 20 years behind."
schaffrillas,frozen-2013,Frozen,2013,2019-05-26T05:04:10.319Z,3.0,"Yeah yeah yeah it's fine, has some good songs and characters but also some bad songs and characters. It's inferior to Tangled and Moana in nearly every way but at least Olaf is funny"
schaffrillas,aladdin-2019,Aladdin,2019,2019-05-25T15:42:18.873Z,2.5,"Half the time it's surprisingly good, well-acted and compelling. The other half it's hilariously incompetent to the point of providing tons of ironic enjoyment. So, I had a good time overall and I don't regret seeing it. It's a little sad that that's the bar I'm judging these live-action remakes on, but there we are."
schaffrillas,brave-2012,Brave,2012,2019-05-23T04:56:20.434Z,1.5,"Yeah no this is worse than Happy Feet. It's dull, it's predictable, it's a complete embarrassment of a movie. Merida is the most unlikable Pixar protagonist and Disney princess by far, she never gets any comeuppance for turning her mother INTO A BEAR. I hate this movie so much that I don't even want to write about it anymore, it does not deserve a train of thought"
schaffrillas,rango,Rango,2011,2019-05-22T17:58:52.707Z,3.5,"The only Animated Feature winner I never saw before starting this project, I must say that I was absolutely stunned by the animation on this one. The lighting, the character designs, the environments, everything just pops and makes for such an engaging visual experience. I was really bored with the story for the first half hour or so but things really picked up after a while, leading to some truly breathtaking action sequences and genuinely funny moments. This is also…"
schaffrillas,toy-story-3,Toy Story 3,2010,2019-05-21,4.5,"The inverse of Up, where the ending is what's always praised to no end and the rest of the film is kinda forgotten about. The good news is that unlike Up, this is a rich, thoroughly enjoyable story throughout the entire film. I'm a sucker for elaborate prison escapes and this film delivers, complete with a fantastic villain and great jokes. It's not quite as good as 2 but it's still a worthy successor that builds on 2's themes in a beautiful way"
schaffrillas,shark-tale,Shark Tale,2004,2019-05-21T17:24:52.018Z,5.0,"Why haven't I reviewed this yet? Best movie of all time for sure. Like, I deadass have no idea what score I would legitimately give this movie because I derive so much ironic enjoyment from it.It's ok, a lot of white fish can't review movies."
schaffrillas,john-wick-chapter-2,John Wick: Chapter 2,2017,2019-05-21T02:15:08.476Z,4.0,"A significant improvement from the first, the action is more enticing and the story is more engaging. The two halves of this movie are kinda two different movies, and while the first half is solid enough, the second half is exhilarating and satisfying. I love how well set up the rules of this universe are, to the point where I actually said ""Oh no"" out loud during a certain scene. You know the one."
schaffrillas,john-wick,John Wick,2014,2019-05-20T22:13:15.040Z,3.0,"Took an animation break and watched these movies for the first time. The action here is solid and Keanu is great but I feel like there's way too many conveniences and easy outs for a lot of the characters. Like, John could've just shot the kid at the pool and ended it right there, right? But y'know it's still decent overall"
schaffrillas,up,Up,2009,2019-05-20T15:01:23.721Z,3.5,"Cute kiddie fluff with an excellent opening and score. Take those out and ehhhhh. Don't get me wrong, Dug is really funny and it's a nice little adventure but it's not really thematically cohesive like Wall-E or Shrek 2. If people could stop calling this the greatest Pixar movie based off of the opening alone that'd be great."
schaffrillas,walle,WALL·E,2008,2019-05-20T00:38:27.197Z,4.5,"Stunning. Way better for me as an adult than it was as a kid. The fact that Wall-E barely talks and yet manages to be one of the most well-realized and charming characters in animated history speaks volumes. The environmental message is well handled, the romance is believable. The weak villain is really the only thing holding this back from a perfect score."
schaffrillas,ratatouille,Ratatouille,2007,2019-05-18T04:16:42.847Z,5.0,"The polar opposite of Happy Feet: a rich, intelligent, funny, thought-provoking masterpiece. This is the most underrated Pixar film by far and one of my Top 3 Pixar favorites. It genuinely feels like a smart indie film made for adults, which again, is a testament to Brad Bird's ingenious writing. I will never get tired of revisiting this movie."
schaffrillas,happy-feet,Happy Feet,2006,2019-05-18T02:09:37.268Z,1.5,"Astonishingly bad. There is no story structure, the characters are either flat or annoying, random plot points and themes are piled on top of each other with no rhyme or reason, the character designs are unappealing. I thought Brave was the worst Best Animated Feature winner for sure, but leave it to this movie to prove me incredibly wrong. I can't even believe this is a real movie."

Horror parodies usually make me roll my eyes out of my skull but this one does it with such finesse and absurdity that I genuinely adore it.
schaffrillas,the-incredibles,The Incredibles,2004,2019-05-16T16:28:31.794Z,5.0,"An absolutely flawless, mature family drama. It genuinely feels like it was written for adults first and kids were kind of an afterthought. Animation as a medium rarely gets better than this."
schaffrillas,finding-nemo,Finding Nemo,2003,2019-05-15T05:21:28.230Z,3.5,"A lot funnier than I remember. Stunning animation, very emotional and entertaining. I'm not a huge fan of Dory or the Tank Gang and some scenes aren't as good as others. But a really good entry in the Pixar canon, even if it's not a favorite"

Might as well review them yoSo Shrek is really good. The cast is pitch-perfect and their line deliveries add so much to their characters. Very mature love story with great humor, though a little dull at some points. Pales in comparison to Shrek 2 but still a great movie in its own right"
schaffrillas,pokemon-detective-pikachu,Pokémon Detective Pikachu,2019,2019-05-11T02:40:53.127Z,3.5,This. Movie. Is. BONKERS. Suffice to say I will have a full review out in a couple days but in summary I really really really liked it
schaffrillas,the-shape-of-water,The Shape of Water,2017,2019-05-10T16:36:30.405Z,3.0,"Such a strong year for movies, such a forgettable Best Picture winner. The direction and score are fantastic; Del Toro and Desplat definitely earned those Oscars, but the story is largely uninteresting and the slow pace doesn't help matters. Michael Shannon's character is kind of a joke and not really intimidating, and even though I love weird stuff in movies I draw the line at fish sex. Oh, and that scene in the movie theatre? Painfully pandering. You're better than that, Guillermo."
schaffrillas,first-man,First Man,2018,2019-05-09T02:26:14.337Z,2.5,"Damien Chazelle is my favorite director, and his direction is the best part about this movie. But maaaaaaaan, this script does not match the brilliance of his presentation. It's exceptionally dull and I don't buy Ryan Gosling in this role, I'm sorry. Great performance from Claire Foy and some excellent sequences here and there but the screenplay really sinks this one for me."
schaffrillas,bee-movie,Bee Movie,2007,2019-05-07T02:19:37.229Z,2.5,"Such a bizarre movie conceptually, but it's kinda boring in its execution. The plot is haphazard but it's not Shark Tale levels of hilariously incompetent so there's not a ton of ironic enjoyment to be had. Patrick Warburton is the best part but that goes without saying"
schaffrillas,edge-of-tomorrow,Edge of Tomorrow,2014,2019-05-02T19:35:31.099Z,4.5,"A phenomenal, underrated action movie. Time loops are my jam (I'm the biggest Majora's Mask fan on the planet, after all) so this movie's fun premise, coupled with great performances and solid direction makes for such an incredible moviegoing experience. More people need to see this."

It's a top 3 MCU movie for me and I could watch it a million times without getting tired of it. I will be making a video about why this is a perfect sequel, don't you worry."
schaffrillas,incredibles-2,Incredibles 2,2018,2019-04-22,3.0,"Ah yes, the original ""painfully average"" movie. Upon further thought, it's way better than the other films I've given that moniker to. It's fun, has great writing and inventive action, and the score is solid. Filler nonsense and a weak plot/villain/finale really drag it down, and it has little to no emotional weight. But it's still enjoyable; if we only had to wait 2 years for this instead of 14 then I think I'd feel a lot better about it overall."
schaffrillas,spider-man-homecoming,Spider-Man: Homecoming,2017,2019-04-22,3.5,"Better than I remember. Funny, cute, exciting. It's cool to see how normal people live within this universe and I like the small stakes story that still manages to give the hero a chance to prove himself. The car scene is top tier MCU."
schaffrillas,captain-america-civil-war,Captain America: Civil War,2016,2019-04-21,4.0,"The smartest Marvel movie, but also kind of the dumbest. If Cap had just communicated better with Tony then 80% of the movie's conflict would've been solved. Also Zemo's plan is bonkers. But yeah pretty fantastic in spite of the narrative flaws"
schaffrillas,indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,1989,2019-04-19T02:43:21.423Z,4.5,"This movie is Raiders, but better in like, every way. It's exciting, it's super funny, you buy the emotional connection between Indy and his dad, the villains are great, the action is superb, Marcus Brody is such an endlessly entertaining buffoon. Just watch this movie if you enjoy fun. It's the best Indiana Jones movie and one of the best Spielberg movies."
schaffrillas,ant-man,Ant-Man,2015,2019-04-18T20:33:10.907Z,2.5,"It's cute for an hour but then I got really bored and I wanted to turn it off. Rewatches have usually slightly improved the Marvel origin movies for me, but it did the opposite here"

It's a gigantic tonal mess with awful slapstick and comic relief, but this one ultimately has some of the best dramatic moments and songs in the entire Disney pantheon. The stage adaptation is better but kudos to Disney for really giving it their all with this one and creating a cult classic that's starting to gain more recognition as time goes on"
schaffrillas,the-big-sick,The Big Sick,2017,2019-04-09T02:13:33.082Z,4.5,"An exceptionally enjoyable rom-com with solid performances from everyone involved.

schaffrillas,iron-man-2,Iron Man 2,2010,2019-04-08T16:32:13.478Z,2.0,"This movie is actually pretty solid for a first hour, but after Tony Stark pees in his suit the movie enters a downward spiral that it never recovers from. Still, if this is the weakest MCU movie, we could be doing a lot worse."

So glad I saw this in a theater with people, there's such a lovely energy to a crowd enjoying this movie that makes it even better. Yes, people are going to compare this movie to John Wick– and they should– but the best sequence in this movie IMO is a great hospital fight sequence that feels straight out ofShoot 'Em Up, which is fitting given that both this movie and that one are so heavily influenced by Chuck Jones.

The flashback framing device is as unnecessary as it does in any movie, and the movie seems a bit unfocused (why is Geena Davis's Dottie the main character when it should clearly be Lori Petty's Kit, why does Tom Hanks's character (and a lot of the other characters) go through no real growth that we see and just sort of become good over time) but it's so sweet, and impressive, and pleasant.

This movie is mostly fun moments of living in monster world, and that's enjoyable enough to carry it. Its emotional Pixar stuff isn't as strong as any other Pixar movies, but the third act puts in a lotta work to make up for that.

The movie would benefit from more charismatic (or honestly maybe just more well-known?) leads, but also from focusing less on hitting every story beat and letting some of the comedy play out more. This is something that would KILL with some more improv, or at least more of the improv feel most blockbuster comedies have nowadays. (Is there a woman director with Apatow/Rogen’s joke pacing? We need one.) All of its emotional beats are... not great. But it’s surprisingly sex (and sex work) positive, and fun, without ever wholly demonizing its characters."

Keanu isn't great, but I blame that on Joss Whedon's annoying dialogue more than anything else. (Seriously, is there a worse last line to put in a film this good?) Dennis Hopper is SO GOOD. And the action is phenomenal. This is a new favorite."
demiadejuyigbe,while-you-were-sleeping,While You Were Sleeping,1995,2016-03-29,3.5,"Holds up well for a 90s rom-com! Really sweet and really funny. There are some unnecessary beats that ring as a demand for higher drama, but it's still fun to watch. Joe Jr., especially."

He's GREAT at ""show, don't tell"" which seems like a side effect of the film scene in Austin, as it was certainly something they stressed when I was down there. This movie is a mystery, and it's meant to be, but I think it left me with more questions than I came in with. Michael Shannon is great as always, but it's hard to tell who else gave a great performance because everybody says maaaaybe ten words each?"

The film is a lot better than I think most people expect it to be, and although it was probably hurt by being released in close proximity to the very similar Friends With Benefits, I would say it's not a bad movie by any stretch. Jake Johnson, Greta Gerwig, Ludacris,and Mindy Kaling kill it in secondary roles, too. Kevin Kline is weirdly unrecognizable to me in it."

Alison Brie's English accent is the first in recent memory to not be awful, as many American-English accents are. Chris Pratt is definitely the comedic standout, and it's a shame the wedding scene is so sweet and creative because it means it can't be done in real life now without being fairly unoriginal.

Premium Rush felt like a movie I'd see on Nickelodeon in 2002 with a young, recently-formerly-teenage heartthrob in the prime role, i.e. Clockstoppers, or Agent Cody Banks or something. The acting wasn't very good either. There was a really weird, unnecessary cameo by Sleigh Bells in a single scene."

Everybody either loves this movie or hates it, and I fall in the former camp. It's possibly the most beautiful film I've ever seen, and if you can't see it in a theatre, you should seek it out on Blu-Ray on a large-ass television. It's a wonderful picture of a 50s family that might be slow at times, but it really gives you a terrific feel for all of the characters, despite not having a ""story"" per-se. Sean Penn is pointless in it."

demiadejuyigbe,punch-drunk-love,Punch-Drunk Love,2002,2012-08-06,4.0,"Easily Sandler's best. Stunning cinematography, wonderful story, a great tale of loneliness and love. I'm still a bit confused about a bit of the film (particularly the harmonium's role and the crash at the beginning of the film) but great. There's also an interesting Superman fan theory about the movie that is interesting and worth a read."
