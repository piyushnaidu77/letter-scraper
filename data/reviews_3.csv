clbsilencio,body-heat,Body Heat,1981,2025-11-08,4.0,hot in a way where i could almost ignore that i was looking at william hurt for two hours
clbsilencio,vice-2018,Vice,2018,2025-11-04,3.5,rest in piss dick cheney <3
clbsilencio,with-soul,With Soul,2024,2025-11-08,2.5,"definitely felt like it dragged on, needed something to either synthesize the story down or pull it forward with more momentum"
clbsilencio,the-history-of-sound,The History of Sound,2025,2025-11-05,2.5,like the male version of a world to come (and I didn't like that movie either)
clbsilencio,cruising,Cruising,1980,2025-10-21,4.0,friedkin and I are both still wondering what this would've been like starring richard Gere

clbsilencio,turtles-can-fly,Turtles Can Fly,2004,2025-09-28,4.0,"Takes on an almost mythical quality with all this grey mist and slick mud invading more and more of the film as the runtime marches along. ""Satellite"" and his gang of children feel as though they live in a world just parallel to that of Agrin and her bastard son until the slightest graze intersects the two as the tragedy reaches its peak. The second half of this truly did feel like something out of folklore---the deathless child, the deep lake, the high cliffs..."
clbsilencio,elephant-2003,Elephant,2003,2025-09-25,3.5,"Do I believe we need to be inundated with school shooting movies? No. Do I agree with a lot of the criticisms of this film? Also no. Two things can exist at the same time.Van Sant's bit of having practically no character development didn't bother me all that much, it feels like a Dunkirk-esque choice that leaves me feeling mostly meh. However, I do feel that the portrayal of the shooters' radicalization could've used a second read-through. Were we this clueless in 2003? The hatred these boys have didn't translate, they felt too much like kids playing war until all of the sudden they're psychopaths."

clbsilencio,heroic-bodies,Heroic Bodies,2022,2025-09-13,,"the information presented here is compelling, but the formal aspect of the film is admittedly lacking - I can only assume constraints on archival footage etc. is partially to blame but nevertheless the film suffers for it."
clbsilencio,sunfish-other-stories-on-green-lake,Sunfish (& Other Stories on Green Lake),2025,2025-09-12,3.0,"the first episode in this anthology is absolutely the strongest, and while the project as a whole might fall into cliches at times, who cares because I certainly wish my thesis film would get accepted into Sundance!"

I couldn't help but feel that some of the emotional impact of the story was taken out when we are completely removed from the language, though I do respect such a bold choice.

Later works contain deeper levels of craft and complexity while plumbing the same psychosexual depths, but earlier movies like Blue Velvet still feel like a complete thesis.

The chassis is all right here, as James Cagney plays a producer who comically rushes to create prologue segments for movie theaters before his financial backers close in, all while his secretary (Joan Blondell) juggles all the details and keeps things afloat as the movie goes manically from stage to stage.

The story is a now-familiar tale of a young man embracing the quick riches of a life of crime, although there are some sharper edges courtesy of the pre-Code era. Cops are shot, goons get got, and the ladies are hot, although you still get disclaimers about how crime doesn't pay. And for some…"
herb_gallow,flee-2021,Flee,2021,2022-03-06,3.5,"Somewhat of a non-standard take on the refugee's tale here, focusing much more on the isolation of the experience and the effects it can have years after someone successfully makes it into another country.

Michael Moriarty is a once-promising Hollywood B-lister who parlayed some early high-profile roles in movies like Bang the Drum Slowly into steady supporting role work in TV and film throughout the 80s, culminating in a prominent role in Law and Order. Deeming this productive existence too boring, Moriarty then blew up his career and left the show over a deranged one-sided wharrgarbl feud with then-Attorney General Janet Reno, going on…"

herb_gallow,titane,Titane,2021,2022-02-23,2.0,"This feels like a step back from Raw. That movie wasn't necessarily revolutionary, but it did some daring things on top of the sexual awakening chassis, and established Julia Ducournau's ability to film physical violence as well as any of the other modern French masters of that art. The body horror paired with the deceptively fresh-faced setting felt like a unique signature.Here, she leans way, way heavy on the Cronenberg, and I don't think it's an unfair comparison to…"
herb_gallow,dogs-2016,Dogs,2016,2022-02-22,2.0,"Here's a slightly odd slow-cinema crime story set in the Romanian countryside. Thankfully, this isn't like five hours long as other intentionally slow efforts tend to be, but it also feels like there isn't much story there, as a result. A young man inherits his grandfather's country estate in the hinterlands, which has been kept empty for decades so that the grandfather's gang could use it for various nefarious purposes. He wants to sell it, the remaining gangsters don't want…"

The story revolves around Rahim (Amir Jadidi), a man in prison for debt who concocts a scheme on his two-day furlough to sell some gold coins found by his girlfriend, but backs out after his conscience gets the better of him and returns the lost merchandise. Local media picks up on his good deed, and the attention from that causes people to look a…"

herb_gallow,drive-my-car,Drive My Car,2021,2022-02-17,4.5,"The temptation is to transpose the events of this movie onto the story of Uncle Vanya, which serves as the scaffolding of Drive My Car. That'd be a convenient Rosetta Stone to the lives of the characters here, and it would maybe demystify some of the interactions between folks if there was indeed a 1:1 resonance with the actors and the roles they've been assigned. That doesn't feel like Hamaguchi's intent, though, and regardless, most of the pleasure here is…"
herb_gallow,bad-lieutenant,Bad Lieutenant,1992,2022-02-16,4.5,"Both Abel Ferrara and Harvey Keitel are very close to the perfect expressions of their screen selves here. Ferrara, with ample chemical enhancement, constructs the apex New York hellscape that cinema had been building toward since the late 1960s. Keitel empties his toolbox in a completely gonzo performance where he hits nihilistic violence on one end of the wavelength and extreme vulnerability on the other. The resonance between these two meeting on this level of performance reverberates through the rest…"
herb_gallow,antlers,Antlers,2021,2022-02-16,1.0,"This might have been fun had it been true to its nature as a spiritual DTV schlock exercise. There are glimpses of something worthwhile whenever the camera lovingly pans over the mangled bodies left behind by the movie's antler monster, which are a welcome opportunity for practical effects to come to the fore. Instead this is a weirdly incompetent effort with a ton of established names tied to it that takes itself way too seriously for something that's like a…"

I can't imagine the sand it would take for someone to agree to play Lucille Ball, herself an incredibly gifted actor.

It also opens with a random scumbag bashing his pregnant wife into a wall to the point of a TBI, which is fairly unpleasant and a little higher-octane than the rest of the movie warrants. Getting through this portion of the movie takes some work, especially the police scenes (which operate on the idea that the cops can…"
herb_gallow,the-8th-night,The 8th Night,2021,2022-02-06,1.0,"Basically if someone made The Wailing, except bad. A monster vanquished by Buddha in times of antiquity returns because an archaeologist got angry and decided to unleash a portal to hell on everyone. Thus begins a series of actions taken for bewildering reasons that lead to a couple of monks fighting the monster, who possesses corpses in search of a lost relic that it needs to destroy to the world.The gore is mostly off screen, so there’s no real…"
herb_gallow,that-uncertain-feeling,That Uncertain Feeling,1941,2022-02-05,3.5,"A Lubitsch remake of one of his earlier silents in which a stale marriage is interrupted with various infidelity hijinks. Melvyn Douglas plays a stuffy old insurance salesman, Merle Oberon plays his flighty, dissatisfied wife, and Burgess Meredith is a vainglorious pianist who makes a play for her.Not quite as top tier as some of Lubitsch’s greats, especially in the earlier going before things start getting wacky. The Merle Oberon character is also a little unfortunate since she comes…"
herb_gallow,dune-2021,Dune,2021,2022-02-04,3.5,"In the sense that a barely comprehensible, niche franchise has been successfully adapted for a mainstream Hollywood production, for what most would consider the first time, this is certainly a triumph. The Dune books have never been my thing but I respect that achievement. Something on the order of the Lord of the Rings, if the second half of the story is pulled off well.I have the same feeling about this as I do about a Spielberg production. Which,…"
herb_gallow,house-of-gucci,House of Gucci,2021,2022-02-02,3.0,"Does exactly what it says on the tin. A pretty straight up biopic of the Gucci family executed in a competent-but-not-spectacular fashion by stalwart Ridley Scott. At least with this one it’s not a canonization and thus can be a little more fun than most of these, since it’s covering a sordid and shocking event and the players therein.I always enjoy seeing Lady Gaga on screen, and she’s expectedly the main draw. The omnipresence of Adam Driver continues and…"
herb_gallow,claires-knee,Claire's Knee,1970,2022-02-02,4.0,"An idyllic lakeside retreat frames an intricately told story of a man settling a few bits of personal business prior to getting married. The action is driven between Jerome (Jean-Claude Brialy) and old flame Aurora (Aurora Cornu), a writer who playfully goads Jerome into pursuing the daughter of a local landlady.Befitting the film’s vacation land setting, this moves at a leisurely pace, and through its characters goes in for a deep exploration of desire, the purpose of romantic dalliance,…"
herb_gallow,munich-the-edge-of-war,Munich – The Edge of War,2021,2022-02-01,3.5,"Interesting cinematic presentation of the revisionist view of Neville Chamberlain’s historical legacy. I’m not sure if I entirely buy the premise that the Munich Agreement bought enough time to be the difference for an ultimate Allied victory, but I am of the view that Chamberlain takes way too much historical flack for the political realities of his time.Jeremy Irons performs to his usual high standard here and paints a believable portrait of a conflicted man. The underlying story of…"

BOOM!",2021,2022-02-01,2.5,"Might be that I’m just the wrong person to ask about this movie, since I’m not really one for musicals as a general rule, and Rent especially just wasn’t my thing. Still, this is suffused throughout with a sense of being way more charmed with its main character, a pre-fame Jonathan Larson, than anyone else possibly could be. Like other biopics it’s a hagiography, and in this case one made by a theater person essentially canonizing one of their own.…"
herb_gallow,the-last-duel-2021,The Last Duel,2021,2022-01-30,1.5,A mostly tiresome morality play beset by a lot of really odd narrative choices that work against it a majority of the time. Starting with the choice to import a bullet-point list of #metoo topics into the Middle Ages and then construct the story in a superficial Rashomon device.The whole interesting thing about Rashomon is the subjective nature of what’s “true” and how that changes based on personal viewpoint and the desire to fit a narrative to one’s own…

That’s not a reaction I have often.Like, this isn’t just “man that’s some weird imagery how random lol.” This is a fully realized world that plays by its own internal and incomprehensible rules, which is impressive to set up. There’s some stuff about the Cold War and cultural influence and whatever but it doesn’t matter. Not really. This is a journey of a pizza-loving dwarf and his internet…"
herb_gallow,the-harder-they-fall-2021,The Harder They Fall,2021,2022-01-28,3.0,"As a modern day blaxploitation flick, it ain’t bad. You’d be forgiven for expecting maybe a little more given the A-list cast, and that was sort of a consistent feeling watching this. You keep waiting for this to hit a higher gear, with the sets, the personalities, the gunfights, and it never quite gets there.This probably could have used a better director. Jeymes Samuel is more known for being a musician, and parts of the movie feel very much…"

Frank Baum, the man himself, and the unfortunately ill-fated production company that he started for the purpose. The Oz franchise is interestingly ahead of its time in its attempts at being a multi-media empire; Baum supplemented his best-selling book series with stage plays, radio dramas, lectures, and three movies in 1914.The translation to the screen is a little imperfect, as various…"
herb_gallow,bedlam,Bedlam,1946,2022-01-24,3.5,"Producer and writer Val Lewton concludes his run of budget RKO horror movies that were way better than anyone had a right to expect with Bedlam, a standard Karloff heel demonstration that's been given a little extra spice. Boris Karloff plays the villainous overseer of the the 18th century Bedlam mental institution, who takes exception to the criticism of his patron's latest girl, played by Anna Lee.I'll always have a place in my heart for the efficient, studio go-to…"

Lee Tracy plays a Walter Winchell analogue, and the story follows his rise from hustling ad copy hack to nationally syndicated gossip columnist, specializing in the bedroom exploits of the rich and famous. Snappy jokes a plenty and a generally lighthearted good time as Lee Tracy feuds with a popular bandleader (played by then-newcomer Dick Powell), lays waste to everyone around him with the power of scandal,…"
herb_gallow,the-master-2012,The Master,2012,2022-01-23,4.0,"This proves to be something of a frustrating and uncertain experience as Paul Thomas Anderson provides you with precious little ground to firmly stand on. Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) is an unreliable narrator as our protagonist and in addition to being a habitual liar is also delusional and prone to confabulation, as expressed both through his own dialogue and numerous sequences that are apparently dreams with no clear bounding lines between them and the other parts of the story. Lancaster…"
herb_gallow,the-house-2022-1,The House,2022,2022-01-22,4.0,"Houses not doing what they’re supposed to do is a nicely effective channel for sending chills up the spine. Sometimes they’re haunted, sometimes they don’t obey physical laws, sometimes they draw attention from unwanted parties. The house that serves as the throughline for our three part animated anthology in this case is a sinkhole for hopes and dreams, a theme that’a expressed well in all three segments.The first segment is probably the most disturbing of the three, detailing the…"

Fanchon (Pickford) is a mischievous, forest spirit-like presence that becomes more interested in the affairs of the nearby town as she becomes a young woman. Melodrama and a romance ensue.Beautiful restoration for this one which is available for streaming through Amazon Prime, albeit with a soundtrack that is all right at times but veers into…"
herb_gallow,judge-priest,Judge Priest,1934,2022-01-22,2.5,"Will Rogers vehicle, a story about a humane small-time judge who dispenses jokey wisdom and general humanity to the folks around him in his rural Kentucky town.The movie is fairly corny and plays like a version of To Kill a Mockingbird except everyone’s kind of racist, but it really is fascinating in a historical sense. Starting with this being a good demonstration of the Will Rogers spirit, and he does have an innate humanity that just makes you feel…"
herb_gallow,my-lady-of-whims,My Lady of Whims,1925,2022-01-20,2.5,"Clara Bow plays a bohemian socialite who scandalizes her old guy father by living it up in Greenwich Village. Old guy dispatches young hothead to go pressure her into coming back home, antics ensue.In terms of the movie itself, pure filler designed to show off Ms. Bow, though that's no sin given how easy she is to look at. Some fun scenes of partying in a New York speakeasy, and a really odd comedic side bit involving the young guy's assistant, a Buster Keaton stand-in that keeps pulling a gun on everyone, which provides more discordant notes than humor."
herb_gallow,eaten-alive-1980,Eaten Alive!,1980,2022-01-19,3.0,"One of Umberto Lenzi's three contributions to the Italian cannibal film genre that he helped to create, alongside Man From Deep River (arguably the movie that kicked things off) and Cannibal Ferox. While you can see how movie producers and studios would be constantly talking to each other and poaching ideas back and forth as to what's going to make money, it's interesting just how specific a formula these movies are, despite the differences between the directors who made them.…"
herb_gallow,the-tragedy-of-macbeth,The Tragedy of Macbeth,2021,2022-01-19,3.5,"Part of me thinks that one of main reasons Joel Coen directed his first solo feature after almost 40 years of collaboration with his brother Ethan was to wrong-foot everyone that came to see whatever he made. No matter how hard you try, you go into a Coen Brothers movie with a certain set of expectations, even when they're doing stuff supposedly against type like No Country for Old Men. You try to set that aside going into this movie,…"
herb_gallow,the-runner-2022,The Runner,2022,2022-01-18,2.5,"Less a horror movie than a new EP from the synthwave band Boy Harsher. Be advised, Shudder browsers.Light fare that struggles at times to justify the presence of the alleged premise; a woman covered in blood runs around in the woods committing acts of violence, to an unknown purpose, and what will she do next. Mostly, a collection of Boy Harsher music videos, with interstitial segments involving the titular runner doing stuff for some reason.The music videos aren't…"

Someone somewhere has written books on that that, but it does feel like we do everyone a disservice when we pretend that there's a clear, dividing line between childhood and adulthood. And a lot of that feels like it's mostly to avoid awkward subjects and conversations.This movie is interesting,…"

Yes, I know that I'm not technically forced into doing that. Anyway.Adam McKay continues his transformation into the left wing Dinesh D'Souza with this one.

herb_gallow,the-pale-door,The Pale Door,2020,2022-01-16,2.0,"And now, to cram some cowboys into a movie with witches. Joe R. Lansdale serves as executive producer here, though unfortunately it doesn't look like he had much of a hand in the screenwriting. Beyond the Lansdale-y premise, this is pretty standard stuff. An outlaw gang gets more than they bargained for on a train heist, and runs afoul of a coven of witches. Neither the outlaws nor the witches get much depth to them, even with a brotherly love…"
herb_gallow,the-friends-of-eddie-coyle,The Friends of Eddie Coyle,1973,2022-01-16,3.5,"A pleasingly bleak window into an old hood’s creaky world of poorly-weighed risk. “The Friends of Eddie Coyle” is apparent early as an ironic title for the events that make up the story. Eddie (a late-stage Robert Mitchum) is a low-level con who acts as a middleman for various criminal enterprises, lately as a supplier of guns for bank robberies. Eddie, of course, has no friends, just a collection of people who will do jobs with him on occasion and…"
herb_gallow,old-henry,Old Henry,2021,2022-01-12,4.0,"Good old, stick-to-yer-ribs serving of Western cinema. A spare production that leaves the set pieces and sweeping vistas at home in favor of Tim Blake Nelson brooding in the hills. Location-wise, about which I'm particular, the landscape of Tennessee (where this was shot) ain't Oklahoma (where this is set), but it's fine. Not nearly as jarring as watching New Zealand stand in for Montana earlier this year.It's a good character study for Nelson, playing a hard, wiry farmer who…"
herb_gallow,wings-1966,Wings,1966,2022-01-11,4.0,"Couple of weird little synchronicities accompanying this movie. Both the director (Larisa Shepitko) and star (Maya Bulgakova) ended their lives in car crashes, something that's hard to put out of mind when watching a sequence where planes crash. Maya Bulgakova's last film credit also happens to be, weirdly, Terminal Velocity in 1994 (her only American film), in which of course planes and crashes and such figure prominently. Kind of adds to the forlorn feeling of Wings.Well observed and understated…"

How do you manage expectations when you put Sion Sono and Nicolas Cage together. Anything short of Magilla Gorilla materializing in your living room and flinging piles of literal ape shit at you is bound to disappoint on some level.This is a strangely subdued movie for something that does, to its credit, feature Nic Cage getting multiple body parts blown off, nuclear mutants, and Bill Moseley. Things feel…"
herb_gallow,aria,Aria,1987,2022-01-03,3.5,"An anthology of heavy hitter directors of the mid 1980s, representing features, stage productions, and music videos, tied together with opera scores and an interweaving plot involving John Hurt as a haunted stage performer.The operatic sensibilities provide a loose thematic current which is played with as the various directors will. Never a particularly coherent movie, but certain segments are worth the going just on their own. Ken Russell stops by to drop some car crash Salome imagery that must…"

herb_gallow,the-exorcist,The Exorcist,1973,2021-06-09,4.0,"I talked earlier this year about how I find William Friedkin to be more of a workman director than a virtuoso, which is kind of strange given the great heights of some of his films, The Exorcist among them. I still hold that view, but this latest viewing has me giving the old man a little more credit.The things that pop culture chose to preserve are of course all the Linda Blair shit, thus creating a feedback loop where…"

Stuff like the Surrealists and the Dadaists doing this always amuses me, as people get into slap fights about whether the thing that's about deconstructing narrative meaning or whatever is doing so in a manner consistent with the larger meaning of whatever it is they're trying to do.There is a basic axis…"

It's clear that this era of filmmaking really resonates deep in him, but there are times where it feels like an unnecessary distraction from what's really going on. This is an early one, so maybe that's more apparent than the gauzy, shiny weirdness that's more perfected in something like The Saddest Music in the World. The thing that he…"

It takes a lot of skill to present Ed and Lorraine Warren, two unapologetic God-botherers who served as standard bearers for the Satanic Panic mindset of the 70s and 80s, as modern-day heroes. I wonder sometimes whether the Conjuring movies are ever screened at the rowdier church functions. It wouldn't shock me since these are so strangely wholesome.

Lasting entertainment value in the form of some impressive dog wrangling. The dogs do various coordinated tricks and dances, and even a few costumed dramatic routines into the bargain.

A new girl shows up to a boarding school and, like every other one of the female students, develops an intense crush on one of the teachers.As a film experience, something of the standard melodrama, without much in the way of technical flourish, though there are some memorable bits here and there.

The preferred term in most quarters is ""magical realism"" but I think that misses the visceral nature of it, putting snotty airs on the thing and a veneer of academic certitude.

It’s like the old canard about Hemingway. You’re focused on imitating him, or you’re doing everything to not imitate him, but no one’s ignoring him.

Fear isn't the same revolution in visual style that Caligari is, but it's got a nicely twisted throughline to the same species of mental fuckery.Bruno de Carli plays a hapless member of the European gentry who comes back from a journey abroad as a shambling, nervous wreck, consumed with thoughts…"

Although I'm not really certain what Robert Wise was going for here. Starts off as a moody psychological drama, starring workaday TV guy John Beck and on-the-cusp-of-respectable Marsha Mason having their happy New York family menaced by an ominously looming Anthony Hopkins for unclear reasons.

The French Connection, as far as this kind of thing goes, won Best Picture of 1971 at the Academy Awards. It enjoys a towering reputation as one of the best films ever made.

Don't know that I found it to be that, and it's more of a standard home invasion thriller than anything else.If anything, the cues set you up for a French countryside horrorshow a la High Tension and other, more impactful movies.

There's the Cool Guy in the Shades and One Earring, the Reagan Stockbroker, the Big Haired Girl What Shows Her Boobies (Tawny Kitaen, naturally), and the Free Spirit New Age Psychic. A good time capsule of how American pop culture…"

I don't know that this is nearly as effective without the goofy 70s singer narration (recorded by David A. Hess, who plays the main villain), which is complete with a theme song for the murderous gang that feels like it should be in The Dukes of…"

Draw enough to go and check this one out since I missed it back in 2013.The plot is framed in a pseudo-found footage style, told from the point of view of a Vice reporting team being sent to check out a religious community deep in the jungle of an unnamed country, the hook being that they're following up on a staff member's sister (Amy…"
herb_gallow,reaptown,Reaptown,2020,2020-10-23,2.0,"Rough hewn little indie scarer about a woman on parole looking for her missing sister in a haunted train museum.This one has got a little more artistry going for it than the average microbudget streaming project. The movie is set in rural Nevada, a mountainous, desolate and beautiful location that lends a lot of its very unique flavor to the film's look. The director does a good job leveraging that asset, one that you don't see in many other…"

I get why Sacha Baron Cohen does this character and what he's trying to do with it. For someone that seems determined to hold a mirror up to the uglier parts of American society, though, Cohen really doesn't understand America or why things have gotten the way they are here now.Back in 2006, it was a road trip through the South and its gaggles of dumbass neoconfederate…"

And maybe more focus on the annoying kid character? Of course you would.This is basically the same film as the original, minus some of the better-shot kills and with more Satan's Helpers assisting Damien as he grows into the role of Lil' Antichrist. This time there's less drama since you know immediately that Damien…"

I'm old enough to remember his schtick as a slightly lunkheaded manly man goofball, and it didn't play all that well in the first Poltergeist movie even. Here, it's turned up to an obnoxious degree, as he's more of a central character and is primarily defined by a ""father knows best"" sensibility of family and casual racism. I don't much like applying…"
herb_gallow,the-omen,The Omen,1976,2020-10-21,3.5,"The way this is such a direct embodiment of British-American horror is neat. Got your American star, Gregory Peck, playing the US Ambassador to the United Kingdom, allowing him to traipse about in all kinds of great countryside shots and stately manors. All American vigor with the bonus of the signature ""horror pastoral"" thing that English productions do so well.Time-worn entrant in the creepy kid genre. The strength here is the wise choice made by a young Richard Donner…"

It's like yanking one of those blobfish up from the deep sea. You're taking a fine fellow like the Mothman, whose natural environment is in the backwoods of West Virginia and on websites that still have things like counters and ""under construction"" .gifs, and hauling him in front of the bright lights. This never stood a chance, Mark Pellington's previous success with the fine Arlington Road…"

As I was in fact tempted to do at several points during this. Aside from some weirdness at the beginning, this movie takes a while to really get into its premise; a secretive movie studio cult offering a young actress (Alexandra Essoe) the chance to sell her soul for stardom. For quite a while, it's a mundane affair focused…"

Director Patrick Brice and Duplass star in what starts out as a humble videography about an awkward, weird man attempting to find friendship. From the start, though, the narrative rug-yank is telegraphed pretty hard (you are watching something titled ""Creep"" after all) and you wait expectantly for…"

The premise has been beaten into the ground so often lately that it's just ridiculous. This time around the world's been thrown into apocalypse mode because of some bit of radio frequency or some such, it's not explained well, and it's our protagonist's job to fix it in an adorably millennial way.The framing device is our lead Aubrey (Virginia Gardner) grieving the loss of her best…"

And sadly, the scenes that are cool, set pieces of bizarre and grotesque violence, are marred by terrible early 00s CGI work. This gets cited sometimes as one of the few examples of the successful video game - cinema transition, but it's not even really Resident Evil tier.It's at least somewhat amusing just from the sheer stupidity of the characters' decisions.…"

That undercuts this one, since it signals a number of things that kind of deflate the tension of the movie. You know that ""the people are the real monsters(TM)"", and you can rest assured that someone is going to have to do something horrifying at the end.

Combine that with the film's opening scene, in which said bro, who looks to be in his early 30s, has a ""you're not the boss of me"" argument with his parents, and you've got a main character who you're not invested in at all.Not that would have helped much anyway, since his actions make no sense from moment to moment, going from…"

There's some bits in the beginning that feel a little awkwardly staged, as though they were arranged after the fact, but nothing that gets terribly in the way.

I wasn't surprised at all after watching this to find that director Antonio Campos is a denizen of NYC, and that this was produced by the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal. I don't doubt that they were honestly going for authenticity, and likely…"

VHS seems like it suits her thing so well, but I do respect the determination to not become hidebound.

herb_gallow,tenet,Tenet,2020,2020-09-15,0.5,"Christopher Nolan has completed the journey up his own asshole. This was a subpar spy movie with the patented Nolan faux-intellectualism smeared all over it. Unlike previous products like Inception (a decent heist movie at heart) and Interstellar (an all right sci-fi movie underneath), Tenet isn't even a good action movie after you sift through all of the internally inconsistent applications of reverse entropy or whatever the hell Nolan thinks he's trafficking in.The only actor here that seems like…"

Keep your eye on that guy.Our minds like to organize based on past experience so I'm tempted to say that this has got a feeling of Spielberg to it, in the way that Patterson constructs a fantastic, immersive world for his audience from the very beginning.

The relative lack of new content in 2020, though, keeps forcing my hand on stuff I would otherwise never have looked at, for good or ill.

herb_gallow,unpregnant,Unpregnant,2020,2020-09-11,3.5,"Would be easy to ding this for being a strictly formula exercise in the teen buddy comedy genre, which it is. Every single general plot movement will be one that you anticipate miles in advance. And in terms of recent examples, this lacks a lot of the off-the-rails humor and star power of Booksmart. But, as it says on the tin, what differentiates this is being one of the first comedies to prominently feature an abortion. Certainly the only one…"

I should probably feel some sense of revulsion at this exploitation film set in a concentration camp. Many apparently did, earning this a spot on the infamous British ""video nasties"" list, and I guess this is still banned in some countries. That seems like what a normal person would react with. I just spent this bored.But then, how can anyone take this seriously? This is super-amateur level stuff across the…"

There are a few threads back to Italian B-cinema, mostly in the form of Marjoe Gortner, who plays the hapless husband to the demon chick. Gortner was in Luigi Cozzi's famed Star Wars ripoff Starcrash, as part of his strange journey from child revival tent preacher to C-list actor. The gore in this one isn't nearly as explosive, the effects aren't as good,…"

Helen Twelvetrees is one of those. She's got a face perfectly designed for heartbreak, impossibly sad eyes and trembling lips. One of those faces that's so unusual that it keeps pulling you out of what you're watching. Hers is one of the more bitter stories of Hollywood, like the universe wanted the…"

But what Birth of a Nation is to mainstream cinema, The Hypocrites is to the auteur. Lois Weber wasn't just the first major female film director. She was one of the most important directors in early cinema, full stop, with a filmography and box office receipts that rivaled D.W. Griffith. The sheer volume of her output ensured that one…"

They just keep on coming, waves and waves of them, like some sort of living tide of reanimated, unstoppable corpses. It takes a lot to make the effort to watch these days.Overcoming that soul-weary zombie fatigue is a feat in itself these days, and for that director Jeff Barnaby is to be commended. Continuing his penchant for indigenous horror films, Blood Quantum depicts the ever familiar zombie apocalypse from the view of a Mi'gmaq reservation…"

The dude undeniably has the ability to make an entertaining movie, and has that Spielbergian talent for competently managing large budget productions. This thing, though, with the fronting like he's an intellectual, it grates. It bothers me because we end up with things like Batman being viewed as some sort of active participant in American thought. And I don't like emperors clothing types.I've avoided this for years because I didn't want…"

And the parts showcasing those elements are all right, decent enough if forgettable.The after market parts are worth noting, however. This one’s helmed by a female director, Anvita Dutt.

Cul-de-Sac Man is the American cousin of Japan's hikikomori, in that he's a sort of waste product of his culture, passively enabled in self-destructive behavior until he's essentially useless and spends his remaining years waiting around to die.

Interestingly, for a movie that starts with Crispin Glover in the prologue and begins with a shot of Gibby Haynes getting blown in an alley, this is far less apeshit than you might think it is, instead opting for a more meditative, mystical approach as William Blake (Johnny Depp) reckons with his inherent nonexistence.The West provides its usual backdrop as a place where laws only nominally exist, letting its characters forge their own…"

This is the later stage of her fascinating career, which started in mainstream film and theater and fanned out increasingly into the postmodern as a direct challenge to the idea of rationality. And unlike most postmodernists, she had enough of an unwavering and true understanding of that concept that she took it to the logical conclusion in her 1982 suicide. If nothing else, Jane Arden the artist has my attention.…"

I remember the first Toy Story film blowing people away, the animation at the time light years ahead of where everyone thought CGI was, and hey not badly written either.

There's a romanticism around it that's unique in American sports; something that's specially keyed to those with a hardened cynicism, in order to allow crusty old bastards to express things in a ritualized form. Maybe that's what allows films from the baseball movie's golden era of the 1980s (and the 80s-adjacent early 90s) to maintain relevancy.

An unforgettable visual experience, starting with the outlandish costuming and then Nazimova herself, wearing a series of abstractly beautiful designs as the action progresses.The cool thing about this is how the sexual urges of men and women are portrayed, not as two different things but as forces that, while having their own flavor, change shape and direction from moment to moment.

You'd think that might be a signifier that Vivarium belongs in that elevated ""serious horror"" category, but it speaks more to this being a substantial, polished effort with most of the sharp corners sanded off.

The scarcity of 2020 releases forces us all into watching stuff we wouldn't ordinarily watch. I'm glad that this wasn't as punishing an experience.I mean, it's not great either.

It's certainly true that Hallelujah, the first major studio release of the sound era to feature an all-black cast, traffics in broad racial stereotypes. There's plenty of examples of white writers putting Uncle Ben dialogue into the mouths of the black characters, and Irving Berlin does a lot of interpretation of what traditional black music sounds like through the ears of a white guy.

Hapless person encounters The House or something tangentially related to The House then dies horribly. White Ghost is a solid execution of such, set off by a killer opening.

For a goofy movie about a grunting cannibal woman that avenges herself upon her captors with lawn mower blades and teeth, this is primarily an effective portrayal of domestic abuse. It's effective because Sean Bridgers (whom most will know as the hapless Johnnie from Deadwood) is very, very good in the double-faced abuser role.

It's impressive that Lindo, at 67, still has a credibly physical presence on the screen. Of all of the Bloods in the film, he's the only one that still seems capable of violence, which becomes ridiculously apparent as this devolves into a war film every bit as silly as the Chuck Norris and Sylvester Stallone Vietnam movies that Spike Lee makes fun…"

Silly story that's more a mashup of like twelve different movies rather than being a straight rip-off of Alien as advertised, full of horrible dialogue and a plot makes little to no sense.

But it was a smart, carefully constructed film that tapped into some powerful narrative currents to do that most worthwhile of things, making an audience feel uncomfortable.

It's easy to watch Candyman in 2020 and lament the many missed opportunities to fully embrace the racial issues it dredges up from the nation's consciousness.

I'll content myself by noting that even today, Conrad Veidt's murderous stare, the set design, and the commentary packed into officials scribbling away on high chairs, perched like storks over their work, still hit very effectively.Avoid the copy on Amazon Prime, which continues to do silent films a serious disservice by streaming the cheapest and shittiest versions possible."

The poster for Bandaged, as well as the promo copy, suggest some sort of psychological/Cronenbergian horror film centered around a deranged doctor, and the opening credits sequence does little to dispel any of that.

That false-reality narrative and the ""ooogedy boogedy it might kiiillll youuuu"" conceit hits some delicious trash matinee flavors, along the lines of a liability waiver being peddled in the lobby next to the popcorn.

Leigh Whannell has discarded almost everything from the original Universal horror staple except for the central premise; guy what’s invisible causes mayhem.

I get the streamability angle, but I've never quite understood how The Office maintains immediate cultural relevancy with the younger set, despite the fact that most of the latter-day fan base seems to have never held a job.

The setup is pretty keen; a hardened criminal (Dennis O'Keefe) escapes from prison with the aid of his San Francisco-based crime boss (Raymond Burr), but it's a setup to essentially get him killed in the attempt, as O'Keefe took the fall on a rap and might talk due to going stir crazy in the joint.

After plenty of moral finger-wagging following the success of gangster pictures like The Public Enemy, studios felt the need to put out counterpoints, portraying former villain actors as crusading crime fighters in order to restore the balance of the universe. James Cagney was a part of this effort at safeguarding the thin barrier between order and movie-induced lawlessness, of which Great Guy is a part. Personally, I can't wait until Joaquin Phoenix's…"

World War I remains the most important lesson history has for the modern person, and remains something that's shrouded in ignorance. So I'm excited whenever I see something that'll get people talking about that period of history, but it's rare that the essential spirit of the thing is captured.

One of the primary ones is his continued demonstration that horror and comedy come from a very similar psychological space. There's always tons of camp in his movies, but it's not like it diminishes the horror. Whether you're looking for laughter or screams, you're setting a very similar stage. The filmmaker invents a world that resembles our own, but in this one we know more is possible, things that will be…"

I almost checked out after the exceedingly goofy introduction, and the ending sequence was only there to make a reference to Eyes Without a Face and then conclude with a pointlessly silly dialogue that was beyond even the loosely defined rules of this film's universe.

I'm unaware of how much editing surgery went on in post production to make this into two coherent films, but for something designed to be of a single piece by a man known for deliberate choices in filmmaking, it does cleave nicely into two halves.The easy distinction between the two films is the feel of the respective settings.

This is a really cool little ghost story, and I like the deviation from the traditional narrative in having the ghost being the main character, and the viewer being aware that they are indeed a ghost from the get-go.

herb_gallow,villains-2019,Villains,2019,2019-09-26,2.5,"You have to know who you are. Villains has a lot of charm on its side, but I wonder if there was any struggle between co-directors Dan Berk and Robert Olsen in establishing exactly what kind of movie this was going to be. It's hard to tell if they want this to be a quirky indie crime movie, a horror film, a black comedy, a road movie, or something else entirely. Yeah, it's possible to have something that weaves elements…"
herb_gallow,booksmart,Booksmart,2019,2019-09-25,3.5,"Best example this year of why it’s important to unplug yourself from consensus opinion sometimes. Booksmart was neither the transcendent experience its partisans advertised, nor the overly politicized screed portrayed by its detractors. Expectations kill, every time.What this is: a sweet, just silly enough graduation tale which is firmly in the female perspective. And as that kind of a film, it’s perfectly fine, an enjoyable way to reel off a couple hours and a solid recommendation for the younger…"

It isn't the propagation of dumbass memes or Russian flashmobs. It's the fact that almost nobody is properly equipped to consume, and more importantly, disseminate information. Yes, I include you enlightened liberals in that statement. That's a big, big fucking problem when everyone has infinite information and an infinite audience sitting around…"

Marriage is like a re-enactment of The Cask of Amontillado, except in this version of the story both people get bricked up behind the wall together. Two people choose to erect a legal barrier that will close them off together from the rest of the world, the bricks made out of reprobation and alimony. Some like to pretend that it represents commitment, but commitment is there already within a relationship, a necessary condition of its…"
herb_gallow,the-conquest-of-the-pole,The Conquest of the Pole,1912,2019-09-23,4.5,"A strange melancholy here. That's not something I generally associate with the works of Georges Méliès, but the historical context presses in. It's 1912, and it's nearing the end for our dear Méliès. In the decade or so since he showed the world what cinema was capable of, the rest of the world has started to catch up. Techniques in camerawork, editing, and yes, special effects, have been refined as the art form has taken off. More than that, story…"

Friends, let me tell you that this entry into a prescient view of the private prison system remains as relevant as it did in 1991.How can we expect to achieve meaningful reform when prisons are beset with super-powered kung fu crime lords controlling the living conditions in these places?

I also occupy a place in time that's not optimal for viewing Masculin Féminin, since it's loaded with contemporary cultural references (although le Bob Dylan is timeless). I found these factors to be strong currents to swim against, especially since this is the kind of film you really need to meet halfway. If you haven't disabled your pretension…"
herb_gallow,the-bible-in-the-beginning,The Bible: In the Beginning...,1966,2019-09-18,1.5,"The box office king of 1966. Understandable given its epic scope, inexplicable given how it stretches two and a half hours into a lifetime.You go into this hoping that John Huston will do something interesting with the world's most well-known source material, and that the actors associated with this will be worth the going. George C. Scott, Peter O'Toole, Ava Gardner, Richard Harris, etc. form a heavy hitter cast. And all of the big-budget spectacle elements are there, primarily…"
herb_gallow,the-battle-of-algiers,The Battle of Algiers,1966,2019-09-17,5.0,"The perfect time and place for an application of the neorealist approach. Paradoxically, the studied neutrality of Gillo Pontecorvo's approach in filming The Battle of Algiers makes it a devastatingly effective piece of propaganda. Truth bleeds from this, and Pontecorvo is unafraid to show the full scope of the violence carried out by both sides in the conflict. His only professional actor delivers a strangely sympathetic portrait of the man directing the French campaign of brutality against the citizenry of…"

Though I have to admit, the idea of pranking your father by sending your girlfriend over to get him all hot and bothered and then pulling the reveal in front of your mom is pretty funny, in an uncomfortable and man-that-family's-too-close kind of way."

The soulfully beautiful Barbara Stanwyck, the dapper Adolphe Menjou, and the rascally Ralph Bellamy, all directed by the hallowed Frank Capra. Best of all, this story is allowed to go where it wants to in the pre-Code era.If you've committed to watching a melodrama you've already waived a whole lot of your disbelief, but it's hilarious to watch in the beginning as…"

A group of three women and one man try to cross an unforgiving desert, a prospect that kills the man but not before he spends his final moments indulging in ""man's vagrancy"" and feeling up his wife's friend. The rest of the film is occupied mostly by the wife creeping around murderously, waiting to axe-murder the misunderstood friend. Thankfully for her, the group happens upon a…"

herb_gallow,the-goldfinch,The Goldfinch,2019,2019-09-14,1.0,"There are few things more irksome than a movie that pretends it's smarter than it really is. The Goldfinch is meant to be some sort of, I dunno, exploration I guess, of the past and how events in our history shape us as people. Or something. There's also some narrator-delivered insights about how we perceive ourselves, but by that time I was gripping the sides of my seat in order to keep myself from walking out. I never read the…"

That’s just how she goes sometimes. So when the first reaction of our main characters at…"

I can't think of many films that I loathed as much as this one in the first thirty minutes, only to find myself at the end having enjoyed the total experience. Granted, I came to this one with a lot of baggage. I find the idea of American palette swaps repellent, and if I hadn't found myself with some unexpected free time I'd have likely left this in the darkness of ignorance. The…"

Kicking around with solid segments on well-regarded horror anthologies V/H/S and Southbound, and after getting a misfire out of their system with Devil's Due, here we have the feature length project we've been waiting for with them.

Not even because I was particularly invested in the first movie, which was okay but not great. As a studio effort, this was so poorly planned and executed in the background that It Chapter Two just stood no chance whatsoever. It's a credit to the cast involved that this is watchable at all, and it's the performances and a couple of the terror sequences that rescue this from being…"
herb_gallow,hawaii,Hawaii,1966,2019-09-09,2.5,"An impressive assemblage of Hollywood talent comes together to make an epic mondo costume drama and thereby get paid. Hawaii was the second-highest grossing film of 1966, and was something of a unique stopping point for quite a lot of people. George Roy Hill, more notable for directing films like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting, leads the way in his only big-budget epic production. Max von Sydow stars in one of his earliest mainstream Hollywood roles.…"

When a movie is relying as heavily as It does on well-established storytelling and visual tropes, the experience becomes more about how receptive you are to the kind of tale being told on a given evening, since the film isn't going to really stop you in your tracks and demand attention by doing something that you're not going to see somewhere else.This time around, things that annoyed me seemed more…"

We were all convinced that the greatest threats facing us were Satanic child care centers and backmasked rock lyrics. The streets were about to be ruled by merciless gangs, and naturally these gangs would be organized around various thematic concepts, complete with costumes and appropriate nicknames.Continuing on in the wake of The Warriors’ world of neighborhoods ruled by murderous cosplayers, Troma takes things further by envisioning…"
herb_gallow,young-torless,Young Törless,1966,2019-09-05,4.5,"This one's armed to the teeth. Young Törless is about the failure of rational analysis when applied to the human animal. It's about the predatory core of sexual desire. It's about the hypocrisy of the polished veneer that each person presents to society. It's about institutionalized cruelty. It's a young German's exploration of Nazism's legacy in his homeland. One of the few things it's not, humorously enough, is a coming-of-age tale. Those stories involve a protagonist being catalyzed into both…"

The first, shot the previous year, was dinged for historical inaccuracies, leading to the film's seizure by authorities, the expulsion from the country of its French director, and a demotion for a general who served as a military advisor for the shoot. The Romanian government, it turns out, is a harsh critic.The Independence of Romania met with a…"

Every time she appears on film, it's like Chicago through a funhouse mirror. There's a hard-bitten Great Lakes sensibility to all of it, and it's not as intimidating as Chicago, but the residents all seem like they'd be sizing you up. Maybe they wouldn't stab you, but they'll palm your wallet. What I like most about it is that it's a place where the spirit…"

herb_gallow,queen-christina,Queen Christina,1933,2019-09-02,3.5,"You get the impression when you watch Garbo that she occupies the wrong time period. That's a weird thing to say in regard to the personification of Hollywood glamour in the 20s and 30s, but it's always tempting to imagine what she might have done had she appeared in an era with a more expansive view toward what women can do on screen. Almost every time Garbo appears on screen, she conducts herself as someone who has little use for…"

The spirit of goofiness that he’s going for here does outstrip that famed $35,000 budget.The predictable factors weigh this down. The acting is just brutal, even for a self-aware ultra low budget parody. And for some reason the cheap, home made priest collars was a detail that kept snagging me. It’s hard to fault the special effects…"

As is Commissar Greta Garbo.Lubitsch at the helm with a Billy Wilder script is a powerful combination, and suitably goofy comedy along with a sweet love story is the order of the day.

The proximity forces comparison when they’re not all that similar apart from the premise.

Camille packs mystique in its background from a historical perspective, that's for sure.

The same gonzo violence and events that escalate hopelessly out of control, elements that would be refined later in Oldboy, are satisfyingly present, Song Kang-ho serving as master of ceremonies this time, although this is more of a tag-team effort with Shin Ha-kyun.

His dynamic camera work is back and on point here, starting with a fantastic shot that pulls back through a long banquet table, laden with food and surrounded by Russian officers, that just keeps going and going. You really miss his dynamic viewpoint when it’s not there.By 1935, Anna Karenina had already been filmed a bunch of times, and this is Greta Garbo’s…"

I won't say that I'd have rather had a straight-up terrible movie, because there were stretches of this that I was glad to be in the theater watching. Bernadette (Cate Blanchett) is a fantastic character, an always-watchable presence for the two hours and change that Richard Linklater has served up for us.

Perhaps I'm more charitable to horror.

By 1930, Garbo was a well-established box office name, and MGM had developed an idea of what kind of roles suited their enigmatic star. Anna Christie, released in both English and German sound versions, gives Garbo speech, and the full actor is now brought to bear.

What is it that made this thing you’re screenifying worthwhile in the first place, and how do you repackage that for the cinematic medium?

Not a whole lot of substance here, just a two set minidrama in which Owen Moore learns to not be a jerk to his wife, Mary Pickford.

So, you don't care for tales of super-powered warriors fighting, improbable escapes, deus ex machinas, gratuitous romance, and third act revenge against bad guys? Well then, you stand against the very roots of narrative itself, because you just tried to crack on The Odyssey. Good luck with that.I think you'd have to work hard to make a version of The…"
herb_gallow,stand-by-me,Stand by Me,1986,2019-08-06,5.0,"I'm taken aback at how well this has held up. Rob Reiner is not a deep man and has inflicted some real three-hanky manipulations on us over the years, and if you're so inclined, you've got all the ammo you need to be dismissive of Stand by Me. It's a Stephen King story, making it an opportune target for the anti-middlebrow crowd. It's a 1950s small-town American vision of a clearly delineated coming-of-age, easy to jettison as musings of a…"

There's a whole roster of Lynch regulars at work here. Laura Dern, Harry Dean Stanton, Jack Nance, David Patrick Kelly, and on and on. Cage fits right in there with his signature combustible goofball vibe. Imagine what both men could do now with their powers heightened further by…"
herb_gallow,maniac-farmer,Maniac Farmer,2019,2019-08-04,1.0,"If there's a dividing line between trash films that entertain and trash films that burgle time, it's conviction. Sadly for director Matthew Williams and friends, he ignores the advice of antiquity and hesitatingly looks back after he's begun his journey. Like Lot and Orpheus before him, all is lost once he deviates from his resolve.If the fact that the film is called ""Maniac Farmer"" didn't tip you off to the grade of film to expect, the first five minutes…"
herb_gallow,the-joyless-street,The Joyless Street,1925,2019-08-04,2.0,"This review is for the cut shown to American audiences, which regrettably runs about an hour and ten minutes. Yeeesh.In this format, what we’re left with is a regrettable melodrama that does a disservice to director G.W Pabst and omits almost entirely Asta Nielsen’s portions of the film. The story is reworked to focus almost entirely on Greta Garbo’s character, a dutiful daughter trying to keep her family from starvation in postwar Vienna after her father (Jaro Furth) makes…"

Iconic scene after iconic scene.There seems to have been a greater appreciation for Jackie Brown lately, which followed this up. What made Jackie Brown a great film is in here too; extended romantic chemistry. The scenes with John Travolta and Uma Thurman together are always my favorite in this one.Vincent and Mia are one of the all-time great depictions of two people just clicking together.

Mauritz Stiller deserves quite a bit of credit for his job directing this. For a film that's almost entirely about the Swedish nobility consuming itself, this production demanded a lot. There are lots of scenes shot from the back of a sled going across rough terrain (including ice), many scenes which take place out in the freezing woods, and apparently they…"

How are you not going to have a good time with a van full of volleyball girls spiking balls into the faces of inbred French hillbillies while trying to avoid being cannibalized?There's exploding heads every time a shotgun goes off, a cannibal cult, volleyball used as martial arts, a decapitated guy that just sort of walks through the background, a guy pulling a chihuahua's head off…"

It was only a matter of time before he literally dipped his wick into the indie/A24 serious drama scene. Just perfect.I like Jenkins just fine, by the way.

For the first hour or so, Serenity seemed like a standard issue brainless thriller, the kind that they film so that people can have a working vacation, in this case a beach trip to Mauritius.

Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the other side of that, a specific period in time now fixed forever in the man's imagination and preserved for us. This is the most hopeful and optimistic of Tarantino's films, even as it documents people at the end of their useful lives. It's also Tarantino letting his love of movies completely off the chain, even more so than…"

Both films are first time directors with an abiding respect for psychological horror planting some stylistic flags. Both directors are newcomers with enough industry savvy to make something that might not feel polished but doesn’t look amateur either. And like Beyond the Black Rainbow, I Trapped the Devil falls a little short of remarkable due to its glacial pacing.Josh Lobo’s an atmosphere man. Cool, I…"

Hard to really evaluate that since few, if any other films can really claim to trace lineage from Django Unchained, itself a rich fusion of the spaghetti western, revenge story and blaxploitation films.

The first twenty minutes is a masterpiece of filmmaking, and the best scene that Tarantino’s ever shot. Unalduterated exploitation delivered by the Basterds and their unstinting cruelty to every German they meet. One of Tarantino’s best written characters ever in Hans Landa. Shoshanna’s maniacal laughter projected onto the smoke of the burning theater.It’s the ways that Tarantino fucks with you that provide the deeper enjoyment to go along with the fireworks.…"

Set in East LA, the spiritual center of the Mexican-American experience. You've got the immigrant narrative. You've got gangbangers. Big family celebrations and relatives in prison. Religiosity and superstition. Politics. The struggle to live in a society that tells you to assimilate but then refuses you when you do. Gregory Nava has a sweeping vision that might not be deep enough from character to character, but wide…"

I'd heard about this one based on my interest in the emerging Oaklandcore scene, and the director was unknown to me. Exciting.

herb_gallow,east-side-sushi,East Side Sushi,2014,2019-07-23,4.0,"The most distinguishing feature of East Side Sushi is its combination of earnest, sweetly gentle storytelling with an unflinching view of what it's like to live your days in an East Oakland barrio. There's a tendency when filmmakers portray socioeconomic distress to go one of two ways; the scary urban hellhole where everyone is constantly killing each other, or the soul-crushing antechamber where people have just enough time to wallow in poverty before something even worse happens. Little danger of…"
herb_gallow,peterloo,Peterloo,2018,2019-07-22,4.5,"Peterloo is a cousin to the Dickensian narrative. The grand scale of Mike Leigh's film and its roster of characters feel familiar. As do the mirrored worlds of towering wealth and grinding poverty, a theme which Dickens stamped indelibly on the English soul, if not its conscience. What makes this interesting is that all of the treacly sweetener of Dickens has been stripped away from this story. There is no angelic woman to serve as the chaste love interest, elevating…"
herb_gallow,the-bay,The Bay,2012,2019-07-21,1.5,"Found footage horror from Barry Levinson, of all people. That carries some novelty.Because Levinson is a seasoned Hollywood pro, The Bay manages to avoid some of the worst parts of found footage. The perspective is broken up into an array of camera viewpoints, the special effects aren't phoned in, and the acting isn't terrible (though it isn't all that great, either). The presentation is slicker than one is used to with these, which makes it much less of a…"

Ju-on: The Grudge doesn't really have a story, outside of the gradually unfolding explanation as to what happened to Kayako in order to turn her house into a gateway to Hell. The budget is barebones, which forces a number of stylistic choices and casting decisions that should have just strangled the film from birth. And for a movie in which (by my count) 15 people die, there's very little…"

The City of the Dead (aka Horror Hotel, woof) is a proper Englishman's scare, even if it's set in New England and even if John Moxey is an Argentinian chap. This doesn't preclude the good old salacious bits to be found in a movie about witches, but these are served at the proper times later in the film. Harrumph.Christopher Lee…"
herb_gallow,walkout,Walkout,2006,2019-07-21,2.5,"Probably more of a teaching aide than a film as such. Edward James Olmos steps behind the camera once more to tell the tale of the 1968 Chicano Blowouts. Michael Peña, playing real-life organizer Sal Castro, opens the film in his classroom, instructing his students and therefore the viewer about the power of who's writing history and telling one's own story.

Are your leads likeable? Is there an actual comedy component? Do you exit the experience on something of a lighter emotional plane than you started? There's honor in being a serviceable movie, and Ana Maria in Novela Land does its job well.The differentiator is that this is an affectionate parody of the hyper-soap telenovela genre, which…"

Not everyone came up in East LA, and not everyone is a gangbanger, a statement that feels obvious but I guess needs to be made. The story of communities in America is generational, and this is a story of how even five years in an age cohort makes a huge difference in how the world looks, interior and exterior. It’s also a necessary counterpoint…"

Gator’s in the basement. Our gator. And then there’s a lot of gators. Me gusta.

Paranoia is always a dominant feeling with these, and Under the Skin is a clever subversion of that mood.

Too long after the event to get any of the thrill of the recent past coming to the big screen, too soon to prevent the history from spoiling the plot from the start.

And in fact it is part of an ongoing publicity campaign being undertaken by the Indian Army and Punjabi filmmakers.

Long, quiet shots, documentation of day-to-day existence, an almost entirely amateur cast. There's no music save an annoying teenage home DJ for a few moments.

After that point, the various Chicano movements had developed fully enough to be able (or more likely willing) to take over behind the camera to tell these migrant worker stories. And there’s nothing wrong with a white guy telling these stories; Robert Young did a fine job of it in Alambrista. Joseph…"

Low points include a painfully long scene in which the villain delivers exposition in a room full of people who are already familiar with all of the villain reasoning and Nick Fury apparently turning his brain off.

I enjoy the vengeance narrative; well-worn as it is, it's usually a pretty efficient setup for gonzo, no-holding-back action violence.

The hero moves from one adventure to the next, meeting a succession of challenges and new characters as he pursues his quest. Robert Young does two interesting things, though; he strips a lot of the heroic elements out of the story, and he essentially removes the voice from the character after the first ten minutes of the film, only really to return at the very end.This…"

The teen girl squad sitting to my side provided ample amusement with the constant tittering and screaming.Lars Klevberg does the job and checks the boxes, which is really all I want. The doll repeatedly creeps people out, and the grotesque animatronic expressions do a fine job on that count. The kills are nicely bloody, with great over-the-top dismemberments and…"

A consummate theater guy, Zoot Suit was an established Broadway play before he filmed a version of it in 1981.

But the hell with it I’ll write something anyway.Not a minute of this feels wasted. Almost every single line is a gag, the action is madcap and the film is chock full of kooky, by-the-seat-of-the-pants plans and schemes. Tony Curtis is great as he switches between three characters, sometimes within seconds of each other, and is hilarious as Shell Oil Junior. Jack Lemmon is a fantastic goofball, and gets funnier…"
herb_gallow,yesterday-2019,Yesterday,2019,2019-06-28,2.5,"Real unfortunate timing here. I feel like we've hit market saturation for musical rises to stardom, the dangers of fame, and CGI crowds filling stadiums to hear classic rock mainstays in the last six months. And to be fair to Danny Boyle here, Yesterday isn't quite as obnoxious in its hero worship as Bohemian Rhapsody or Rocketman before it, although there's more than a little of that going on. But there's still a ""so very tired"" aura radiating off this…"

What do you do, hot shot. It's hard to imagine doing much better than plopping your ass down in an easy chair, settling in with a mild mind alterant of your choice, and just watching Robert Redford do his calm, competent, easygoing thing in…"
herb_gallow,bisbee-17,Bisbee '17,2018,2019-06-26,4.5,"Presenting this as a documentary is a shaky proposition. Robert Greene does not make it clear what the extent of the filmmakers' role was in staging the re-enactment of the Bisbee Deportation. While there are numerous scenes featuring planning committees and local residents preparing for the centennial, we never quite know how much of this is organic and how much this process was coordinated by outside parties. It does seem clear that the re-enactment itself is staged with considerable help…"

Trends toward longer films, more narrative-driven features, and movie stars have been coalescing for some time by 1910, but things will really start to take off from this point. Nielsen, who will come to be known as ""Die Asta"" by her adoring public, delivers a challenging performance in one of the most psychologically complex stories committed to film at this time.

Not sure that I'd call it that, although the first third of the film or so has some funny parts, mostly revolving around Jim Wormold's (Alec Guinness) feckless imitations of Hawthorne (Noel Coward), himself a feckless intelligence operative. From then on things get progressively dark, and…"

I grew up in the East Bay and San Francisco was always the shinier but less authentic cousin to Oakland in the local consciousness, to varying degrees of accuracy. It doesn't help that so many powerful narratives about race have come out of Oakland as a setting in recent years, which invite direct comparison. Still. The weaknesses in the film kept being paired with little whispers in my head…"
herb_gallow,black-panther,Black Panther,2018,2019-06-23,4.0,"A Sunday afternoon rewatch that's granted a little hindsight. 2018 was a landmark year in Oaklandcore filmmaking, giving us this along with the far less heralded Sorry to Bother You and the critically overlooked Blindspotting. This collection of films marks an evolving approach to the black cinematic experience, and something of a fork in the road. There are films which beseech the viewer that black folks are people too, proffering up Christlike suffering to various ends and taking a more…"

I was expecting an eye roll rate comparable to the Incredibles sequel, and thank Movie Jesus it was instead a decently entertaining outing.That said, I wish Pixar had left well enough alone. I’m somewhat conflicted about what their product has become as it stands. The writing is generally above that of the standard issue animated…"

But here we are.The first instinct a viewer might have is that you're looking at one of those homages, and there's nothing wrong with films like that. Berberian Sound Studio is a great example of one, a film that's a love letter to a genre, delivered in a satisfying package. Knife+Heart is something different. Whether or not Yann Gonzalez…"

It's really unfortunate that pepper spray wasn't around in these days.

This guy pumped out a ton of ""trick films"" from the get-go, and had a definite fascination for airships and destruction. Interesting to me that Booth had conceptualized the idea of death from above well before this was viewed as a viable military tactic, which hadn't even caught on until after the beginning…"
herb_gallow,the-sealed-room,The Sealed Room,1909,2019-06-20,2.5,"A little bit of the macabre, and some grist for an exploration of the psychological connection between sexual transgression and living entombment.Noteworthy for Arthur V. Johnson hamming it up as the Count even by early silent film standards, though he does go so far over the top as to be genuinely demented. The Count knocking on the sealed up room entrance and taunting the two lovers as they suffocate is pretty dark stuff, as is his dispatching of his two reluctant stonemasons.Early Mary Pickford appearance, though it's of the blink-and-you'll-miss-it variety."

Even though I don't care for the excessive bumbling and clownery of Tahei (Minoru Chiaki) and Matashichi (Kamatari Fujiwara), I love that this film is basically the story that these two goobers are going to tell together when they finally get back to their village after their adventures. And as a grand adventure story, The Hidden Fortress is fantastic.These stories always seem to go best when the antagonist is The…"
herb_gallow,witchs-cradle,Witch's Cradle,1944,2019-06-17,4.0,"Maya Deren plants the flag of occultism firmly in the unforgiving cinematic ground of 1944. The sensationalized imagery of a woman chanting with a pentagram etched on her forehead must have surely been provocative in a way that would register with a young Kenneth Anger. That's neat and all, but this is packed full of some strangely disturbing imagery beyond the immediate.More than the blaring neon-lit witchcraft iconography, the motifs of strings and lines are what really leave the…"

Especially those abutted by spooky woods. Trouble brewin'.It's hard not to want more from We Have Always Lived in the Castle, which hints at quite a bit of sinister activity and even supernatural elements, but never really fully avails itself of them. There's a pleasing Addams Family vibe from the surviving members of…"
herb_gallow,all-is-true,All Is True,2018,2019-06-16,2.0,"The issues with All Is True are almost perfectly encapsulated in the scene between Shakespeare (Kenneth Branagh, also directing) and the Earl of Southampton (Ian McKellen). It's an underutilization of acting talent, giving about ten minutes total in the film to McKellen, in the same spirit of getting Judi Dench so that she can mostly stand around and frown at Shakespeare. It introduces something fairly controversial (Shakespeare's theorized homosexuality) without delving much into it, tossing a bomb and then forgetting…"

I’ll continue inflicting these films on myself. I was pleasantly surprised. This is inoculated against netflix originalitis by Ali Wong and Randall Park, who really put something into this film. Their writing and the heart with which they play these characters differentiate this from a thousand other algorithm rom coms. The end result is a sweetly told story that feels…"

It’s art, it’s truth, and the truth increasingly poisons, but even so it’s a little rough in the interior mindscape sometimes. So I’ll accept some assistance from a different time, and a different Hollywood.Julius Epstein, one of Casblanca’s scriptwriters, affectionately noted that the story has more corn than the states of Iowa and Kansas combined.

herb_gallow,stenka-razin,Stenka Razin,1908,2019-06-14,2.0,"Early Russian narrative piece about Cossack folk hero Stenka Razin. I'm a little surprised that Vladimir Romashkov was able to make a film about a pretty subversive figure in the midst of the Romanov dynasty's ongoing clampdown on dissent in the era. Nonetheless, the story is apolitical, and most of the footage is of dudes partying, first in boats on the Volga, and then in the forest.Not much of note in this one other than historical significance. It's one…"
herb_gallow,fantasmagorie,Fantasmagorie,1908,2019-06-13,3.0,"Interesting little bit of proto-animation.

herb_gallow,the-adventures-of-dollie,The Adventures of Dollie,1908,2019-06-13,1.5,"D.W. Griffith's debut directorial feature. And of course he heads straight for the racial stereotypes, the action driven by a pair of villainous, scheming gypsies who kidnap a kid because of a minor spat started by their inherent criminality. And to be clear, just because it's 1908 doesn't mean that film is somehow awash in ethnic villainy roles because of the times. The Adventures of Dollie is an outlier at this point and key to understanding the proper place the…"

A film student from a school with no cameras, he was one of the first (if not only) Shaw Brothers directors to film a production in cooperation with mainland China, after amassing a resume that ranged between children's kung fu movies and hardcore pornography. He's an unreliable narrator for the history of Men Behind the Sun, as he's walked back a lot of the initial explanations for how…"

There's more than a little wish fulfillment underlying this impulse that if only we wiped the slate clean without so many people around, which includes any number of unspoken groups that the viewer doesn't care for, we could get it right this time. It speaks to some of the uglier aspects of the zeitgeist.I Am…"

Lord, give us now an actual, legitimate reason to get riled up about a film, that we may know we still feel things beyond reflexive anti or a bean counter’s love of quotas. I wouldn’t argue with someone who finds Deadgirl repellent. But it’s a full measure, and for that I nod my head in acknowledgement.There’s a difference between things…"

This is the kind of heartbreak you set yourself up for when you have an ill-advised love for found footage films.It's difficult to pinpoint the main problem with The Poughkeepsie Tapes.

herb_gallow,rabbits-moon,Rabbit's Moon,1950,2019-06-10,4.0,"Kenneth Anger's work is slippery. You go looking for it on the internet, and you'll find eight different versions of something in the first five results. Anger himself shoots stuff, lets it sit for decades, and then edits and rereleases differing versions years apart. In this particular case, we've got footage shot in 1950 that doesn't get released until the 1970s, and in two distinct versions. Complicating matters, the version of Rabbit's Moon I got my hands on is the…"
herb_gallow,4d-man,4D Man,1959,2019-06-09,2.5,"I love how science is portrayed in the 1950s. It must have felt bracing to look upon the world as a master of the atom, all societal problems just a research group’s efforts away from being solved. There’s a feeling that you’re on the doorstep of Utopia when you see clean cut men and women in lab coats busily coming up with breakthrough after breakthrough. It says a lot about the mindset of the time that a good wellspring of…"

But that’s generally the spirit of this one.I think I may have preferred a straight knock off of the genuine article. It’s deflating to watch a cast of a-listers perform well below their usual standards. Tom Hardy leads the pack looking generally uncomfortable to be there the whole time, which makes any connection with Eddie Brock for the viewer impossible. That’s especially a problem since there’s a romantic subplot,…"
herb_gallow,city-lights,City Lights,1931,2019-06-06,3.5,"I think I prefer my Chaplin in more limited doses. There are portions of City Lights that are right up there with anything that Keaton or Lloyd were doing in this interesting Silent Clown period of cinema. The opening scene with a new public monument being unveiled (remember those? Of course you don't, you're under the age of 100) only to reveal a sleeping Tramp, followed by an overly mannerly extrication is a fantastic start.From then on, it's a…"
herb_gallow,cannibal-ferox,Cannibal Ferox,1981,2019-06-05,2.0,"Kind of a bummer for Umberto Lenzi to be the one generally credited with starting the cannibal film subgenre, only to find himself near the end of the cannibal boom making a film that's a subpar ripoff of someone else's defining effort. And by that I mean it's a bummer for me personally, as I was expecting better. Shudder runs a special warning for this movie before it starts, which naturally sets expectations sky high. That and Lenzi's transparent effort…"

You may not ultimately like Braid's interior logic, but I promise that it exists.

herb_gallow,fireworks,Fireworks,1947,2019-06-04,3.5,"Helpful to consider this one in its native environment. In a vacuum, this is a heavy handed allegory packed with cliched imagery. All of the ridiculous self-seriousness of a student film. Things, of course, do not exist in a vacuum, and in 1947 this was a radical shot across the bow of post-war America.From a historical perspective, one has to respect this film.

There are a number of red flags that go up when one watches Megan is Missing, however:- The presentation of the film as ""educational"" by its director and producers is plainly dishonest.

The majority of this film is about Cosmo's (Ben Gazzara) attempts to elevate the LA girly show circuit, and the crime parts of it, up to and including Cosmo taking a slug in the guts, are treated like an unwelcome distraction from what's really important: French-themed revues anchored on Mr. Sophistication's (Meade Roberts) half-hearted singing.

His habit of nauseating, unwatchable camerawork is kept to a minimum, and when he finally does indulge it feels connected logically to the narrative.

My first impulse is to say that this could have hit a few levels deeper with the familial trauma, but then you’d end up with something that doesn’t have the goofy superpowers angle and suddenly you’re not bothering and you’re just watching We Need to Talk About Kevin instead.

Stock footage of stuff remained a popular draw in 1906, so the Miles Brothers churned it out.Primarily interesting as a showcase of the dogged authentication and restoration work of David Kiehn, of the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum.

A James Williamson product, something from a filmmaker that was all-in on the ""gawrsh moving pictures"" school of thought when it came to his artistic output.

A cheap director, bargain basement script, and C-list actors all keep the budget down. Throw in enough horror elements to get that crowd interested, because horror makes money.

Natalie Portman has been poisoned in my mind from the Star Wars prequels and V for Vendetta, a film more insulting to its source material than Jar-Jar Binks could have ever been.

As a film it's a solid take on the immigrant's tale. As a political statement it's suitably provocative.

I’m not sure that’s entirely inaccurate.

And this is the best of the baseball movies, smack dab in the middle of the 1984-1993 golden age of baseball movies. More than any other film, Bull Durham gets the psychological pull of the game, the thing that’s made it into a national institution even for those who have never watched a game.This is the only baseball film that I’m aware…"
herb_gallow,28-days-later,28 Days Later,2002,2019-05-23,3.0,"The year of our Lord 2002 was long enough ago now that the post-millennium unease of those times seems like a faraway, quaint little thing. Our apocalypse porn was more hopeful and optimistic then, even if Danny Boyle thinks he's being hard here. It's even funnier when you consider that Trainspotting remains the more harrowing film.With enough distance to truly consider it outside of its place in introducing the ""fast zombies"" subgenre, 28 Days Later is a standard contagion/apocalypse/zombies…"
herb_gallow,the-hole-in-the-ground-2019,The Hole in the Ground,2019,2019-05-21,2.5,"The late 2010s in horror, The Movie.Lots of elements intersecting here. You've got your A24 family-based horror. Your creepy kid trope. Babadook-esque mother/son tension. Lingering forest-based cinematography. It all makes for something very polished-looking and appropriate for its time and place. It also doesn't leave very much of an impression on me. Competent, but unmoving.The relationship between Sarah (Seána Kerslake) and Chris (James Quinn Markey) isn't all that well-defined before the film moves right onto holegrounding the kid…"
herb_gallow,the-wandering-earth,The Wandering Earth,2019,2019-05-21,1.5,"I can't help but kick myself for going into this as blind as I did. I knew the general concept, and I knew that the film was adapted from a Liu Cixin story. What I expected, then, was a high-concept sci-fi flick, which are super hit-and-miss but something which I can usually glean some enjoyment of either way. Nope. The film's primary notability is being a top box office draw in PRC, which has given it international juice. This is…"
herb_gallow,bold-bank-robbery,Bold Bank Robbery,1904,2019-05-21,2.0,"Funny that this movie about a heist came about because Jack Frawley ripped off The Great Train Robbery in order to capitalize on its success the year prior. Early American cinema is dominated by derivative copies of what was successful before, as well as straight-up piracy of European films, whose creators couldn't run back and forth across the Atlantic fast enough to complain about their copyrights.As such, this is a poor copy of that aforementioned film, and in one…"
herb_gallow,westinghouse-works,Westinghouse Works,1904,2019-05-21,1.5,"Documentary footage of the operations of a Westinghouse Electric Company factory floor. The first minute or so is genuinely interesting, as the camera has a bird's eye tracking view through a production floor that's assembling generators, a pretty unusual perspective for the time.Things get repetitive after a while. You can only watch ladies wrap wires around a coil for so long. Primarily in existence so that you can walk away thinking to yourself ""wow, Westinghouse is really, really big."" Take that, Edison."
herb_gallow,night-of-the-comet,Night of the Comet,1984,2019-05-19,3.5,"Fun little cheeseball romp that's elevated by a number of factors. Catherine Mary Stewart and Kelli Maroney are charming as hell as high school sisters navigating their way through a standard issue zombie apocalypse, giving the film its kooky bubble gum sensibility. Both women are having a good time riding motorcycles and taking target practice with Uzis in the streets of a now-roomy Los Angeles, and while there's moments of peril it's nothing so high-stakes that it undermines the essential…"
herb_gallow,invisible-ghost,Invisible Ghost,1941,2019-05-18,2.0,"Strict paycheck fare for Bela Lugosi and director Joseph H. Lewis. Fans of spectacularly inept police procedure will thrill to a house where several murders have been committed of unconnected people but no one living there has been investigated seriously. Stay for the forensic evidence gathered by people who wander into and out of the house, after the crime scene has been poked and prodded by the help.Monogram Pictures knew what they were doing, and like so many audiences…"

Korine’s stated aim is to portray people without any sort of judgment, and from that viewpoint this film is interesting.

Though it’s hard to imagine how Stahelski is going to keep topping himself after this one.High points include fighting on horseback through the streets of New York City, the extended fight in the antique weapons collection, John Wick breaking a man’s neck with a book, the Moroccan guest locale they used this time out, Asia Kate Dillon as the Adjudicator, Charon finally…"
herb_gallow,a-dark-song,A Dark Song,2016,2019-05-17,4.5,"I’m becoming a big fan of Irish horror. Steve Oram too, who gets a fantastic part in A Dark Song alongside Catherine Walker. Liam Gavin joins the ranks of promising horror rookies with his first feature here, and it’s a solid one.A hard, haunted woman and a drunk, vulgar occultist cut themselves off entirely from the outside world in a country manor for months. It’s a great setup, and the ability of Walker and Oram to carry these roles…"
herb_gallow,safety-last,Safety Last!,1923,2019-05-17,4.5,"The opening shot of Safety Last is wonderfully perverse. Harold Lloyd is shot somberly through bars with what looks like a noose in the background, sober-faced relatives bidding him farewell. The scene is of course just him leaving a train station to the big city, but it’s such a weird little fake out that has little thematic connection to the rest of affairs. Lloyd just thought it was a funny goof to play on the audience, and it’s such an…"
herb_gallow,reservoir-dogs,Reservoir Dogs,1992,2019-05-17,4.5,"That mortuary is still one of the more iconic locations in movies. I don’t think I caught what it was the first time I watched Reservoir Dogs, and I think that’s because there’s just enough of the building’s original purpose left over without being too clumsy with visual cues. The drains, the industrial sink, the leftover containers of fluid. Best of all, the loading dock, Mr. Orange bleeding out on the ramp to Heaven. The action leaves the rendezvous point…"
herb_gallow,the-pride-of-the-yankees,The Pride of the Yankees,1942,2019-05-16,2.5,"Groucho may have had a point with his observation that one can't make a director out of Wood. The Pride of the Yankees commonly shows up on lists of the most inspirational films, the most important baseball films, etc. It ought to be remembered instead as one of the most notable wastes of film talent and resources of the 40s. Anyone with an appreciation for the history of baseball is also ill-served by this huge missed opportunity to immortalize one…"
herb_gallow,maple-leaf-viewing,Maple Leaf Viewing,1899,2019-05-16,1.5,"Hardly a film as such, as opposed to a record of a kabuki play. From a historical documentation perspective, that's interesting enough, I suppose."
herb_gallow,the-great-train-robbery,The Great Train Robbery,1903,2019-05-16,3.5,"Early cinema is all about sudden leaps forward. The landscape is littered with products created mostly because they'll leave your yokel's mouth agape at the moving images on this here screen, so the person who actually puts effort into their product is going to get noticed. Especially the person who tries something new. Edwin Porter is a purveyor of both kino detritus and new things.Here, you've got something dynamic and ambitious.

That's not a fair expectation of anyone, even if such a thing would mean that I could jump into a coffin right afterward, secure in the knowledge that I had seen everything that I needed to.This lives on its own planet somewhere. Clint Gaige, our director, has enough commercial production under his belt that the ultra-low level…"
herb_gallow,moneyball,Moneyball,2011,2019-05-13,4.0,"I spend a lot of time in the Oakland Coliseum, and I was there for games 17 and 20 of The Streak, so it's difficult to approach this like other films. It's unsettlingly personal. Stretches of very familiar ground are constantly in this like the cranes of the port and the concrete tunnels, but familiar faces have been replaced by the likes of Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, Chris Pratt and Philip Seymour Hoffman. It's like cinematic Capgras Syndrome.The strangeness…"
herb_gallow,bang-the-drum-slowly,Bang the Drum Slowly,1973,2019-05-13,2.5,"You have to expect a certain amount of sappiness from baseball movies. Even so, there are places in Bang the Drum Slowly that will test even the most conditioned of genre hounds. It's not quite a three hanky deal, but not for a lack of effort. Kind of a weird follow-up project for John Hancock, who had just filmed Let's Scare Jessica to Death in 1971.The main story is about how you should be nice to people who are…"
herb_gallow,blood-feast,Blood Feast,1963,2019-05-11,4.5,"Is this how people who enjoy The Room feel? Blood Feast is so incredibly in its own tier of bad filmmaking that it’s stupefying. Every single choice made here is so wrong and inept that it scrambles the brain. And yet all I can think of is how glorious it must have been to shoot this. I think of Herschell Gordon Lewis gleefully orchestrating this from a dirty little Chicago office, knowing full well that every right thinking individual in…"
herb_gallow,strike,Strike,1925,2019-05-11,4.0,"Slog through the first thirty minutes or so. The beginning of Strike is pure melodrama and propaganda without much of anything else to cut the artificial flavor. The going is especially tough because of Sergei Eisenstein’s thing where individual characters are tools of the oppressor. The future at one time was apparently stories about lots of faceless people milling around.If you can make it through that, though, the payoff is Eisenstein the artist, the technical master, and yes, the…"
herb_gallow,john-wick-chapter-2,John Wick: Chapter 2,2017,2019-05-11,4.5,"Things like this make Keanu Reeves one of my favorite movie stars. This is a dude that works hard, which you can tell just by his release schedule. He reminds me of an old-school studio property guy, gamely showing up for whatever role you’ve got for him, because an actor should work, by god. And once again, he’s putting in the effort here in part two of the glorious riot that is the John Wick franchise.This is a man…"
herb_gallow,tolkien-2019,Tolkien,2019,2019-05-11,2.5,"Everything you could expect from a stock biopic. Slight variations upon the factory presets include the Meaningful Mid Career Moment at the beginning taking place before Tolkien’s literary career, more room for secondary characters, a decent performance from the Love Interest Muse character, and extra helpings of suffocating Englishness.These kinds of films for whatever reason seem to feature awful performances from their female leads, so it was pleasant to have Lily Collins buck that trend and project some personality.…"
herb_gallow,through-a-glass-darkly,Through a Glass Darkly,1961,2019-05-09,3.0,"As the front end of a loosely considered faith trilogy comprising this, Winter Light, and The Silence, Through a Glass Darkly suffers by comparison. As an aside on that, I'm inclined to take Ingmar Bergman at his more recent word and consider these films not as a trilogy. Instead I take Through a Glass Darkly and Winter Light as the front and back ends of the same conversation, and The Silence as an entirely separate venture. You still have my…"
herb_gallow,body-at-brighton-rock,Body at Brighton Rock,2019,2019-05-08,1.5,"The idea of the scalability of horror occurred to me as I watched this. In the hands of an able practitioner a film should be scary because the director wills it. But inside its walls, what scares the protagonist? That will change from person to person, situation to situation. So when Roxanne Benjamin tailors the boundaries of this film's fear to that of a green young ranger trainee who's apparently frightened by the mere prospect of being outdoors, I'm into…"

And yet there are multiple occasions where we get just that. The opening panorama, amazingly, has some visual interest in the pleasing way that the train in the foreground introduces some additional motion. Beyond that, the continued footage wasted on the front of a blank, featureless building would have taken quite a lot in the way of nutritional deficiency-induced mental slowness to get into.I was a little…"
herb_gallow,mildred-pierce,Mildred Pierce,1945,2019-05-08,2.5,"I suspect that what people are responding to in this film is the Platonic ideal of what it could be. There are some really, really good elements to this that could be made into something great, starting with the stately Joan Crawford and going from there. But I was surprised at just how much this felt like Michael Curtiz finishing a project while he happened to be in Malibu as the eighteenth film he'd shot that quarter. Mildred Pierce in…"
herb_gallow,dragged-across-concrete,Dragged Across Concrete,2018,2019-05-07,4.0,"I dig what's rattling around in S. Craig Zahler's head. The realm in which he operates is a run-down strip mall VHS rental joint populated mostly by decent people who have adapted to their 70s hypercrime world with resigned cleverness. Zahler's ability to work in a universe not our own, but with consistent rules regardless, brings to mind a grindhouse Wes Anderson.The clear border between the rings of hell in this film is great. The viewer is introduced into…"

If this had been made with any sort of intent it might have been crummy enough to piss me off, and I’d rather be pissed off than bored. As it stands, Extremely Wicked Etc. only achieves casual annoyance by portraying almost every woman in the story as a codependent imbecile. But it’s hard to be mad at that because I’m pretty sure that’s the result of bad filmmaking rather than intent.Almost…"
herb_gallow,under-the-silver-lake,Under the Silver Lake,2018,2019-05-05,4.5,"What It Follows was to the coming-of-age narrative, Under the Silver Lake is to hitting middle age. And therefore Under the Silver Lake is wrongly evaluated as a film noir story, the same way It Follows was primarily viewed as a horror film (although it's a fantastic horror film). Don't get me wrong; this is definitely a noir tale. But those parts of the film are in service to the larger narrative, not the other way around.If I were…"
herb_gallow,the-oyster-princess,The Oyster Princess,1919,2019-05-02,4.5,"Just ridiculous. A straight dose of nonstop silliness and goofballery from Ernst Lubitsch, and it’s fantastic. Every element just hits.Victor Janson has a remarkable mug and it’s used to great effect, an impenetrable gargoyle mask that’s a great counterweight to Ossi Oswalda’s maniacal whims of destruction. Julius Falkenstein is hilarious as a good-natured freeloading oaf, and his comedic energy with Harry Liedtke is top notch. The scene where the two men hastily transform their decrepit flat into a throne…"
herb_gallow,wolf-song,Wolf Song,1929,2019-05-02,1.5,"We're way, waaaay too late into cinema's development to be able to have pictures of pretty people carry a movie all on their own. And that's all Wolf Song really has going for it. Gary Cooper is a young man inexplicably hanging out in the woods with a couple of old character actor fur trappers, and his primary function is to look dashing and wash up in the lake. Lupe Vélez is a beautiful Mexican scion in Taos who likes…"
herb_gallow,gully-boy,Gully Boy,2019,2019-05-01,3.5,"Careful with this one. If you hit it in the wrong mood it's going to come across as saccharine and by-the-numbers, especially given the close resemblance to 8 Mile. There's a lot of struggling against impossible odds and talk about how you should follow your dreams and other such things that can numb the senses. The script is the weakest part of the film and threatens to hold it back, though I can't tell if part of that is the…"
herb_gallow,wild-nights-with-emily,Wild Nights with Emily,2018,2019-05-01,4.5,"Take away the explanatory text at the beginning and the end, smooth out some of the jumpier moments of editing, and ease up on the uncharacteristic hamfistedness of the Thomas Wentworth Higginson scene, and you’ve got something close to a masterpiece. I don’t care to lead with mistakes for this film but when a director is as locked in as Madeleine Olnek is here, the mistakes help to remind you how good the rest of it is.Here’s confidence of…"
herb_gallow,american-mary,American Mary,2012,2019-04-28,3.5,"Love of horror doesn't always translate to a good product. Witness Rob Zombie's ongoing affronts against the genre. You can tell, though, when someone loves what they're doing, and it helps add some extra zip on the final product. Jen and Sylvia Soska clearly love what they're doing, and it shows here.Just a good, cleanly done horror film that makes a solid addition to the revenge and body horror subgenres. Katharine Isabelle gets a chance to shine here, and…"
herb_gallow,the-oregonian,The Oregonian,2011,2019-04-28,2.0,"The Kermit the Forg costume was a bridge too far. David Lynch is on such a different plane than everyone else that attempts at imitation don’t even look bad in comparison, so the knock-off BOB and the too-close-to-the-sun sound design and the screams and the woods are all forgivable. It’s when Calvin Reeder decides to splice immaturity into this film that it becomes obnoxious. He would have done well to more closely study Uncle Lynch’s ability to process sexual violence…"
herb_gallow,sweet-movie,Sweet Movie,1974,2019-04-27,1.0,"This is filmed entirely through the lens of how your brain functions when you're too horny to think clearly. That's the only thing I can think of that ties together everything in this film. There's some flailing jabs at Marxism, some commentary on the commodification of sex I guess, and some really clumsily handled stuff to say about childhood sexuality. That last point is probably what got this film banned in a ton of places, although it's a horse race…"

I've enjoyed this decade of films that's given us an entirely new genre, but is this the future? The thought of being back here in 2029 after another 25 films culminating in Avengers: So Very Tired fills me with a sort of existential dread. The financial outlook on these films is so perfected that I worry the…"

The Figurine, which sports a surprisingly detailed Wikipedia article, supposedly marks a transition in Nigerian cinema away from direct-to-video melodrama and into more traditional  larger-scale productions meant for the big screen. There’s some work to do yet.This is pitched as a supernatural horror film, but it’s best to adjust your expectations because 90% of it has to do with middle class anxiety. It’s a…"
herb_gallow,the-beyond,The Beyond,1981,2019-04-26,3.0,"Being the next in the trilogy, The Beyond feels like something a little more lightweight in comparison to City of the Living Dead. That one had a certain atmosphere to it that was absorbing and helped its disparate parts to come together. The Beyond feels a little more scattered, a little slower, and not quite as apeshit.Not that it’s without its charm. Lucio Fulci can be counted on to bring what you’re looking for, which in this case is…"

What does it say about your film when the lead character could be played by Robert Pattinson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, or Vincent Gallo?High Life feels like a real emperor with no clothes moment.

herb_gallow,the-wailing,The Wailing,2016,2019-04-23,3.0,"Feels quite a lot like a supernatural version of Memories of Murder. There's a rural town under threat, a generally incompetent local police force that ultimately proves useless, the same grisly murder scenes repeated over and over, plot misdirections, shamans, and Kwak Do-won even does something of a Song Kang-ho impression during the straighter parts of the film. If you're going to take an existing film as a template, you could certainly do a lot worse. And Na Hong-jin has…"

Relationships are made of people and people are, of course, each their own unique and maddening things. Max Ophüls’ adaptation of the 1897 Arthur Schnitzler play keeps this truth at heart and is all the better for it.La Ronde is a thoroughly charming film that doesn’t have any illusions about fucking (“fucking” and “love” being far less compartmentalized in non-American climes),…"

Hard to say that any have been quite as much fun, however.Most of that spirit of demented amusement is courtesy of Jeff Goldblum, who even at this early stage had an impeccable sense of comic timing and a weird charisma of a proto-Nic Cage variety. And as a bonus, he’s weird-looking enough to serve as the chassis for the monstrous human/fly hybrid that he transforms into…"

If I were making a horror film, and I were feeling in a Kubrickian mood, I would screen this repeatedly for my actors before shooting each day. The sense that something is not right at all but it’s going to continue anyway, there’s a foundation to build terror upon.There are so many elements that are unsettlingly wrong with this that it’s like aliens made it.

The right spot for a more passive vision is somewhere in between the oversteeped cup of tea and the flavorless leaves. Assuming you like tea.Pickpocket gives a clear idea of Robert Bresson the technical master.

Looking at bad acting is like listening to bad poetry and there is not a single moment of this film that does not feature bad acting.I had assumed that a group of film students had decided to upload their final project to Amazon, and I was still annoyed at the sheer laziness and lack of imagination. Turns out, however, that the three directors it took to crank out this painfully stupid found footage exercise all have multiple…"
herb_gallow,the-silence,The Silence,1963,2019-04-17,4.0,"One of the really neat things about cinema is the ability to tweak the brainwaves using imagery. There's a level of storytelling that can take place in a film and not in, say, print, where you can flash pictures at someone and it does stuff to the mind that neither director nor viewer have full control over. With imagery you can elicit reactions from people on a weird, reptile level, quite beyond their control. It's an interesting space to play…"
herb_gallow,pet-sematary-2019,Pet Sematary,2019,2019-04-16,2.5,"A frustrating experience. The 1989 version of Pet Sematary is one of the rare films that could benefit from a remake. I didn't get the impression back then, watching Dale Midkiff wrestle around with a prop zombie toddler and looking at Denise Crosby imitate a Duran Duran album cover, that this was the best they could do. Like Suspiria, this seemed like a prime opportunity to turn a beloved genre classic into something transcendent.Instead, this became something that they…"

He’s been putting out nonstop brilliance with Atlanta on television, after having established a successful career on the screen before that. He’s a fantastic musician into the bargain, adeptly riding the swirling currents of the modern hip hop scene. Dude’s fantastic on all fronts.

herb_gallow,winter-light,Winter Light,1963,2019-04-13,4.0,"The amount of goodwill that Ingmar Bergman assumes you have for his product here, especially in the earlier going of 1963, is pretty ballsy. The opening is slow going, as the viewer gets to sit through an entire communion sequence with minimal distraction. After the point is made that the service is sparsely-attended and mostly old people, the scene keeps going, and going. I figured, and contemporary audiences must have as well, that this is a Bergman film and therefore…"

Fortunately, those elements of the film seem to be there merely as an excuse to mess with Dave Stimple (Adam Edwards), who serves as a surprisingly good straight man for all of the exceedingly silly and sometimes horrifying action around him. Everyone on this production is a first time film participant, but Edwards and Joseph Graham (playing a deranged beardo with glee) are not bad at all…"

For a while I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of follow-through on the no-nonsense cold open, consisting of Victor Clare (Mike Raven) spreading goo on a naked woman and then pouring molten bronze all over her after it’s hardened into a mold. But the rest of the film has a weird, Wicker Man vibe to it that’s its own form of charm.For as lurid as the opening violence is, the middle…"

Maybe it's the constant sense of motion as characters forever weave their way through sub-lethal speeds of traffic and crowded sidewalks.

Following the tandem of Barry Jenkins and James Laxton, and the sun-drenched horrorscapes of Jordan Peele productions, Rashid Johnson deploys Aronofsky conspirator Matthew Libatique. Native Son’s visual signature is the most distinctive thing about it, worn inner city concrete lit by the bright colors of shop signs and graffiti.

Every time a news story comes out about an entertainer, or a politician, or a church, or a corporation, or any powerful entity engaging in acts of sexual victimization (the prurient nature of these stories being what makes them newsworthy), everyone's shocked.

The genre lends itself to little bite sized portions of good old fashioned scares without messing around too much with extended, unnecessary window dressing. The need for a unifying narrative, though, especially in a case like this where it was whatever shorts the producers could find, I’m less enamored with. Patient Seven certainly has one of the dumbest attempts at such.Danny Draven really does…"

Harmony Korine does stuff here that you just aren't going to see elsewhere in American cinema. I'm just not sure why he had to do it in such an obnoxious, sneering way.

The two men apparently corresponded, being in the same general line of work of public spectacle on opposing sides of the English Channel.

The most prevalent feeling I get from this is an overwhelming sense of weariness, and even if the camerawork is jumpy throughout, John Lee Hancock plods along here. Maybe it's because the outcome is a completely foregone conclusion, and we're all familiar with the way Bonnie and Clyde's journey came to an end.

I no longer even casually glance at Amazon's synopsis for films, because the way in which the copy for this was written suggested through poor punctuation that Bitty (Hilary Swank) and Nicky (Michael Shannon) were dealing with the end of a lifelong incestuous relationship.

Almost every aspect of Suspiria is wild, taking a turn at the forefront of the viewer's consciousness.

Distinguishable from their grimy ancestors by high grade cinematography and Hallmark humanism, these films have adapted at the cellular level to the defenses of the enlightened 21st century mind and bypass that feeling of revulsion while still hitting that same mental sweet spot.

Mostly it’s the fact that any sort of continuation to the story after Renton walks away with the payday feels wrong. The ending of Trainspotting is one of the better finishes in film; the characters are old enough to start medicating themselves as their fate becomes apparent, but young enough to still have exuberance and…"

Stroheim seems like he was just born for Hollywood, and you can tell he loves being in front of the camera. He mugs around here as an absurd little Austrian lieutenant groping his way through an Alpine tourist villa, the sheer goofiness of his pickup artist act helping it to feel more humorous than grotesque. Stroheim is adept at portraying characters…"

Almost.The only redeeming features of this film are its fight scenes, and Rapace is one of the select group of female actors working today with enough physicality to convincingly sell brawling violence.

Buster Keaton was a complete fucking madman bent on making the craziest films possible.

What makes The Sting such a quintessentially American story is how it reflects our relationship with grifting.

The American Dream is conning your way to…"

Generally speaking, there's nothing here that hasn't been done before, but it should scratch that ""flesh monsters terrorize a trapped group of survivors"" itch that one occasionally gets.

Even with all the baggage of marriage-as-blessed-servitude and the sanitized presentation of the flesh trade, Edward Buzzell is content to let Carole Lombard portray an actual human without any of the Madonna/whore nonsense.

Others have tread that ground far more artfully so I'll content myself with enjoying this early consecration of that bond.

The mix of traditional illusionary showmanship along with the clever editing techniques is indicative of what makes Georges Méliès a visionary figure.

The easy knock on City of the Living Dead is the story and dialogue, which don't even really make an effort to acquit themselves. The disjointed narrative and the way that even basic everyday interactions don't work as they should in this film just add to its sense of unreality and strangeness.

Unpacking why it is this particular film launched a thousand grotesque ships is another matter. It's tempting to write this off as a collection of mashed up imagery organized loosely along shock and titillation, especially given that this is the product of three directors (Paolo Cavara, Franco Prosperi and Gualtiero Jacopetti).

Tom Noonan and Mary Woronov are pretty heavy hitters in the realm of weird cinema, which makes it a shame that they’re absent for most of the film.

He certainly shouldn’t have felt any shame, and the film is a solid effort from a kid in his twenties on his first directing gig.

With the benefit of insight into the almost two decade long path this film took to release and its stewardship by one of film’s most accomplished technical pioneers, though, one is blessed with the knowledge of just how disappointed they should be.

The first hour of the film is excruciatingly slow, and doesn’t really use that time except to really establish that everything is going to be shot in darkness.

The story of a young adult taking their first steps toward joining larger society.

If you can get past the initial silliness of the found footage format, there's not a whole lot of barriers to enjoyment of Noroi: The Curse.The stronger entries in the found footage canon tend to go lightly on the special effects and CGI, since embracing the cinéma vérité approach means that you're relying on human drama…"

If it's attempting to be an historical account of a part of the First World War, it didn't achieve that. If it's a showpiece for Peter Jackson's technical prowess, it wasn't that either. The depressing conclusion is They Shall Not Grow Old succeeds best at being a piece of propaganda, and not a particularly convincing one at that.The film's lack of historical grounding is a huge detriment, especially considering its…"

It's always embarrassing to see adults wallow around in a journey borne of a seventh-grade boy's locker, and I kept having flashbacks to Suicide Squad and Wanted.

Director Nick Grinde churns out a contract-satisfying sci-fi/thriller/horror mad doctor flick, and by all measures it checks the boxes to keep folks in the theater for an afternoon. The film winds up being a pretty standard Karloff vehicle.The unfortunate aspect of the film is that it's…"

If we were to examine the American judicial system in the manner that Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) examines the case before him, we have to conclude that Sidney Lumet’s portrayal is indeed sentiment.

Something about a mansion makes a fantastic cage for all sorts of real, imagined, and in between terrors, and it’s certainly a great setting here.Later stage Vincent Price was delightful as he haunted the screens of late night horror presentations, but earlier Vincent Price, who graces us here as Roderick Usher, had his charm too. His chilly,…"
herb_gallow,bonnie-and-clyde,Bonnie and Clyde,1967,2018-12-29,3.5,"The Great Depression as a setting continues to hold uneasy relevance in a modern viewing of Bonnie and Clyde, and Arthur Penn’s shot composition, drawn directly at times from famous photographs like those in Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, is a specter haunting our future. Not sure if that was the intention at the time, but regardless the film has taken on some of those implications.That is, of course, the perfect backdrop for the story of a couple…"
herb_gallow,the-discovery,The Discovery,2017,2018-12-29,2.5,"Someone give the “afterlife is real” writing prompt to a director that ingests more drugs. Charlie McDowell executes this story in a very workmanlike, competent manner, and the product is watchable but unexciting Netflix filler.It’s fun to imagine worlds where some basic but fundamental parameter of reality is changed. And yeah, it’s a contrivance to tell a relevant story. But there’s got to be enough logical spadework done to establish your setting as credible. Handing every religious movement in…"
herb_gallow,black-mirror-bandersnatch,Black Mirror: Bandersnatch,2018,2018-12-28,2.5,"This isn’t so much a movie as a video game. That obvious conclusion strikes me as being intended to blow my mind, but it doesn’t really rise above the level of cute gimmick for me. A proper narrative doesn’t have to be an entirely on-rails experience, and there is the precedent of “everything created ever” for differing interpretations of the same thing, to the point of receiving a different experience every time one watches something. Still, the lack of a…"
herb_gallow,if-beale-street-could-talk,If Beale Street Could Talk,2018,2018-12-27,4.5,"The twin pillars of the narrative of If Beale Street Could Talk are suffering and love, and you have to make goddamn sure that elements like that are on solid foundations, lest the edifice collapse down on your head like a rain of papier mache. Suffering experienced by characters that fail to resonate becomes exploitive. Love felt by characters who don't convince is intolerably saccharine. Barry Jenkins has acquired a deserved reputation for stunning visuals (due in no small part…"
herb_gallow,dracula-1958,Dracula,1958,2018-12-26,3.5,"There's a stateliness in this film that suits the story of Dracula well. The novel is a long narrative of politeness and social nicety punctuated by periodic episodes of staking and child murders, and thus this film may be the closest spiritual cinematic successor to it.The film is populated by hallowed practitioners of the craft. Peter Cushing, card carrying member of the Hammer Film Productions stable of holy figures, imbues his version of Doctor Van Helsing with the King's…"
herb_gallow,leave-no-trace,Leave No Trace,2018,2018-12-24,5.0,"For that select few that are embarked on the fully-planned, controlled version of the decision to bring children into this world, there are any number of questions and personal evaluations that others will tell you are mandatory before you do a thing like that. The one I posit is this: Are you prepared to live with yourself after you inevitably damage another soul by living your life? The answer, like any answer to any of these questions, doesn't matter. You…"
herb_gallow,the-endless,The Endless,2017,2018-12-24,3.0,"This may be the first time I’ve ever encountered something in the modern era that was self aware enough to name check H.P. Lovecraft without descending into a screaming hole of inanity. The real space time paradox here is that one version of playing it safe with this film would have been proceeding along the default storyline set up in the first act, which would have made this into strictly filler material. Evil cults, eldritch horrors, blah blah. Instead this…"
herb_gallow,you-were-never-really-here,You Were Never Really Here,2017,2018-12-23,1.5,"For a film that works really, really fucking hard to sell a vision of insanity, Joaquin Phoenix’s Joe is decidedly on the rails here. It’s like a portrayal of Travis Bickle without any of the awareness of how truly batshit crazy he is. Is “finder of wayward girls” really a specialization of the hitman profession? I guess there has to be something to do for a guy who’s irretrievably broken and yet able to murder exclusively in socially acceptable ways.…"
herb_gallow,fantastic-mr-fox,Fantastic Mr. Fox,2009,2018-12-21,4.5,"Wes Anderson could have hung it up after this and been all right. Aside from Rushmore, this is the purest expression of Wes Andersoness put forward. Everything else is attempts to recapture something quintessential to varying degrees of success.The completely constructed reality the film takes place in is a logical extension of the world that Mr. Anderson operates in. And that's incredibly freeing for the work that he's doing. Instead of having to work to incorporate his estate sale…"
herb_gallow,cat-people,Cat People,1942,2018-12-20,3.5,"It's hard to imagine the same set of circumstances that led to this coming together again. A director with auteur sensibilities, a producer tasked by a major studio with cranking out low-budget filler to pad the margins, and a project greenlit around a title. We should celebrate the times when ingredients that should logically lead to a forgettable hobo fire instead result in something interesting.Jacques Tourneur is the reason for this particular season. The story is fucking goofy. The…"
herb_gallow,zama,Zama,2017,2018-12-20,4.0,"The first thought that kept reoccurring as I watched Zama is that Franz Kafka was a few hundred years behind the times. The second thought is that for as class-conscious a filmmaker as Lucrecia Martel is, Zama falls into the same worn groove that Kafka and other purveyors of bleak absurdity do. The world as presented through the plight of the middle manager.This isn't to say that the viewpoint of Daniel Giménez Cacho's Diego de Zama is the wrong…"
herb_gallow,picnic-at-hanging-rock,Picnic at Hanging Rock,1975,2018-12-19,4.5,"As far as absurdist shibboleths go, ""she's quite intact"" may be one of the best in cinema. The wiser heads than most make quite a lot of the sublimated sexuality of Picnic at Hanging Rock, and wisely so. Even if the constant sexual tension strikes me as not all that sublimated. So the fact that absolutely no one is intact got some well-earned laughs out of me. Not Appleyard College. Not the nearby town, not the police force, not Dominic…"
herb_gallow,the-mule-2018,The Mule,2018,2018-12-19,2.5,"Latter-day Clint Eastwood has an essential quality to him. Less man than idea, to the point that I expect him to settle permanently into the form of a 90 year old codger and then continue to make films until the heat death of the universe. Few modern filmmakers have as clearly defined a vision of a culture and place, which in the case of Mr. Eastwood is post-westward expansion America. And thus his truth is not that of the incisive…"
herb_gallow,the-house-that-jack-built-2018,The House That Jack Built,2018,2018-12-17,1.0,"The latest entry from the NXIVM of film directors. Lars von Trier is probably the most enticing temptation to hold art accountable for its creator working today. On the day we give in to those darker of impulses and begin punishing children for the sins of their fathers, a just God will see Mr. von Trier locked into a care facility somewhere remote, to be ignored by everyone save the unfortunate attendant sent into his room to periodically clean the…"
herb_gallow,roma-2018,Roma,2018,2018-12-17,4.0,"The future of prestige cinema marches on. It's a hateful impulse in a person to resist new models on the basis of reactionary loyalty to the past, and so I relented, allowing my Netflix login screen to lead me by the nose after a petulant days-long delay in watching. I cannot say that targeted gatekeeping of content and inescapable prompts are somehow morally inferior to the informational carpet bombing of television. I resent the new form of intrusion nonetheless. I'll…"
herb_gallow,the-favourite,The Favourite,2018,2018-12-16,4.0,"""Why Yorgos Lanthimos"" was my question. Period drama seemed an odd choice. I'm not going to squish myself into the man's skull and guess at why Mr. Lanthimos chose it. But the adaptation succeeds, maybe not as the next chapter in his directorial canon but in what his view brings to the subject material. Certainly in the introduction to the world of the film as a place where duck racing and color-coded fops are the language of power in the…"
