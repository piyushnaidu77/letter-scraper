dorysief,keeper-2025,Keeper,2025,2025-11-15,2.5,cool monsters. cool tatiana maslany. but literally what goes on…
dorysief,christy-2025-1,Christy,2025,2025-11-14,3.0,"From a filmmaking standpoint, this is a fine but ultimately pretty generic biopic - which is a shame because Christy Salters seems deserving of a film with a bit more punch. It did make me care enough to frantically google whether or not she was still alive before the movie ended though."
dorysief,vicious-2025,Vicious,2025,2025-11-13,2.0,"Dakota Fanning is pretty good in this, but she’s not being given much to work with narratively. The film just feels like a weird compilation of a bunch of different horror tropes and ideas thrown together in the hopes that something would stick.Nitpicky, but Fanning’s tattoos in this also feel inauthentic to the point of distraction. The designs and placement look like they come straight off of a Spirit Halloween tattoo sleeve. Don’t know what’s up with that."
dorysief,diary-of-a-wimpy-kid,Diary of a Wimpy Kid,2010,2025-11-12,3.5,"Genuinely did not expect to enjoy this much but, ok, whatever, it’s cute…. Maybe my low expectations were to its benefit.Chloë Grace Moretz existing in this movie kind of took me out of it at times (like, that’s just Chloë Grace Moretz) and it’s weird to accept Manny as a normal human toddler instead of the cartoonish toddler creature that Greg draws him as… but otherwise this is as good as an adaptation of this book could ever get.…"
dorysief,belen-2025,Belén,2025,2025-11-11,3.5,"Started this movie yesterday and haven’t had the chance to finish it until now. Camila Pláate is really great, and the story is equally distressing and important, but the pacing ultimately keeps me from fully connecting with it as a narrative film. The first half is just so much more compelling than the second.Side Note:tagging this with wlw because Bárbara makes a comment about having been with Beatriz Camaño in college(?), but the fact that no one else…"
dorysief,if-i-had-legs-id-kick-you,If I Had Legs I'd Kick You,2025,2025-11-11,3.5,yeah this is stressful and harrowing and rose byrne is great but also the hamster scene kind of one of the funniest scenes of the year
dorysief,the-love-guide,The Love Guide,2011,2025-11-09,3.5,they actually couldn’t make this a good movie because if they did it would be too powerful
dorysief,mogul-mowgli,Mogul Mowgli,2020,2025-11-08,,there’d be no drake without whoopi goldberg… ….I feel like I was missing some necessary context for this movie or maybe I just didn’t understand it idk
dorysief,morvern-callar,Morvern Callar,2002,2025-11-06,3.0,"good concept, and some great acting from the film’s lead, but it was ultimately a bit too slow paced for me. too many long stretches of film where very little is happening. maybe I just wasn’t in the right mood for it. would be curious to read the book it’s based on."
dorysief,criminal-passion,Criminal Passion,1994,2025-11-04,2.5,"It’s a shame when a director makes one really great film (in this case,Desert Hearts) but the rest of their filmography fails to live up to it. Granted, this is the only other film I’ve seen from Deitch, but the average ratings on the rest of her filmography don’t exactly inspire much confidence.BIG shout out to whoever did Joan Severance‘s wardrobe in this (😍) but the rest of the film is instantly forgettable, with poor pacing and even worse dialogue."
dorysief,the-starling-girl,The Starling Girl,2023,2025-11-03,4.0,Really great performance from Eliza Scanlen. Made me feel a little sick to my stomach at times… which I guess means it did its job.Kind of a bittersweet ending. Glad she got out of there but I also don’t know where she goes from here. Don’t really trust her family or church to give her the support she needs but hope she finds her way in spite of them.
dorysief,save-the-green-planet,Save the Green Planet!,2003,2025-11-03,4.0,"Now that’s a movie!!Potentially inflating this rating a bit in my comparing it toBugonia. Ultimately the central conceit of this film is a little too cynical of humanity and its future for me to fully be on board with it on a personal level, but it is cool to see the same concept played out in a way that reallyworks. I’m an especially big fan of the editing in this. The use of notebook scribbles, flashbacks, and…"
dorysief,late-shift-2025,Late Shift,2025,2025-11-02,4.0,"This feels far longer than its actual runtime, but might be one of the only films I’ve seen where I think that quality is a positive. Consistently anxiety-inducing and incredibly human. Leonie Benesch is great."
dorysief,the-color-out-of-space,The Color Out of Space,2010,2025-11-02,1.0,"The opening English scenes in this were so poorly acted that I paused the movie to make sure I wasn’t watching a dub. Thankfully the majority of the film is in German, making it harder for me to tell how good or bad the actors line delivery is.There’s one or two really great visuals of the titular color out of space… but otherwise this didn’t really do anything for me other than bore me. (Sorry.)"
dorysief,twinless,Twinless,2025,2025-11-02,4.0,"Look… I understand the desire to conceal certain aspects of a film’s plot in its advertising to surprise the audience, but if I had known what this movie wasactuallyabout I would have been in the theater day one instead of watching the digital release at home."
dorysief,never-let-me-go-2010,Never Let Me Go,2010,2025-11-01,2.5,"I hadn't heard of this movie until I was recommended it for a discord event back in 2021. I watched it without any knowledge of its plot or the fact that it was based on a book. Although I don't remember my original watch that well (as is the nature of binging a ton of movies in a week) I apparentlythought it was mid. Now that I've actually read the book, I unfortunately still think it's mid but now…"
dorysief,bugonia,Bugonia,2025,2025-11-01,3.0,"Wish this was weirder.This was probably my most anticipated movie of 2025, but I can’t deny that I became a bit apprehensive of it after finding out that it’d be written by the guy responsible forThe Menu. In a similar fashion, this movie is flashy and interesting enough in its execution, but doesn’t feel like it says much of value by the time the credits roll in spite of its focus on real world issues.Jesse Plemons and…"
dorysief,y2k-2024,Y2K,2024,2025-10-29,2.5,"extra half star just for the fun 2000’s vibes, but this is mostly just a mess, especially in terms of its pacing and ever-shifting tone.also I unfortunately can’t hear The Thong Song without thinking ofthatGleescene:/"
dorysief,unseen-2023,Unseen,2023,2025-10-28,3.5,"Started to watch both[REC]andT Blockerstonight but both struggled to maintain my attention, so I tried something that just looked like dumb fun instead. Thankfully was just what I needed. Interesting set up, likable protagonists, and a surprisingly good, nicely saturated color palette. Pretty fun Missi Pyle performance too for the short period that she’s on screen.Good time if you ignore the logistics of getting prolonged cell service in the woods."
dorysief,sorry-baby-2025,"Sorry, Baby",2025,2025-10-27,4.5,"Didn’t know much about this movie before watching it beyond the fact that it was pretty universally beloved by the people I follow on here. It manages to be both heartwrenching and humorous. Melancholy but also sooo warm and heartfelt. There’s such a clear care and understanding for these characters, especially Agnes.Eva Victor should win Best Actress but, because that probably won’t happen, I’ll settle for a nomination."
dorysief,demolition,Demolition,2015,2025-10-27,4.0,I’ve gotta start writing the vending company when my peanut m&ms get stuck in the vending machine
dorysief,v-h-s-beyond,V/H/S/Beyond,2024,2025-10-26,2.0,Some fine concepts in here but the execution often feels lacking. Not big on the framing narrative here at all…Disclaimer:I did not see most of the Dream Girl segment because I was helping my friend make a Casper for her costume
dorysief,fleishman-is-in-trouble,Fleishman Is in Trouble,2022,2025-10-25,3.5,"Really unsure of how to rate this - I might bump it up to a four after thinking on it more - but it’s hard not to get hung up on the fact that Rachel is by far the most compelling character here and I wish she was the central focus for more than a single episode.Libby’s narration in the earlier episodes is often a little overbearing, and I don’t think she and Toby’s history / friendship is well…"
dorysief,regretting-you,Regretting You,2025,2025-10-25,2.5,this movie is so up to date that Mason Thames’ character has aNovocaineposter in his roomthis wasn’t as bad as I was expecting it to be but still not really my thing
dorysief,the-wedding-banquet-2025,The Wedding Banquet,2025,2025-10-22,3.0,"Lacks the heart and care of its predecessor, with messier character relationships and lower stakes. The cast is good, but they’re not given enough to work with.Shout out to the lesbian couple for owning a copy of So Yong Kim’sLovesong."
dorysief,attack-the-block,Attack the Block,2011,2025-10-20,4.0,"Rewatched without subtitles which was kind of a bad decision…but still a good alien invasion movie even if I couldn’t always understand some of the more heavily accented dialogue. Great creature designs, great human characters."
dorysief,black-phone-2,Black Phone 2,2025,2025-10-19,2.5,“We haveA Nightmare on Elm Streetat home.”A Nightmare on Elm Streetat home:
dorysief,offspring,Offspring,2009,2025-10-19,2.0,"I really likedThe Woman, so I figured I should eventually check out its predecessor even if it had bad reviews. Unfortunately, Andrew van den Houten is no Lucky McKee, andOffspringjust feels like a pointless, meandering gore-fest with paper thin characters and subpar acting. There are a few cool ideas in here in relation to the cannibalistic tribe, but they’re simply not fleshed out enough to justify the film’s feature length runtime.This entire story could’ve been a 10-20 minute intro tacked ontoThe Womanand it would’ve been fine."
dorysief,whispering-corridors,Whispering Corridors,1998,2025-10-14,2.5,"I really like the premise ofWhispering Corridors, but I wasn’t thrilled with the execution of its plot. The characters and their relationships to each other feel too underdeveloped - especially for how slow-paced the movie is and how significant those character relationships are meant to be to the horror narrative. The ending is pretty good, but it’s too little too late."
dorysief,nightcrawler,Nightcrawler,2014,2025-10-13,4.5,man is super business savvy and willing to do anything for a quick buck but named his company Video Production News
dorysief,arcadian,Arcadian,2024,2025-10-12,3.0,The creatures are cool and apparentlyinspired by that scene inA Goofy Moviewhere Max has a nightmare about becoming his father. I like how they do the chattering thing before they attack and do… something in the complete pitch blackness. Decent creature feature.none of this would’ve happened if that kid just had his robot smh** [reference to the NetflixLost in Spacewhich 10 people watched]
dorysief,speak-no-evil-2024,Speak No Evil,2024,2025-10-11,3.5,"I probably would’ve seen this in theaters (if only just for Mackenzie Davis) had they not played the trailer no less than 500 times that year. With some distance though, this was pretty good! Takes a bit to truly get going, but once it does it’s a really tense and well acted thriller."
dorysief,dr-caligari,Dr. Caligari,1989,2025-10-10,,"Admittedly the barely there plot causes this to become a little boring after a while (in spite of its ultra short runtime), butDr. Caligarihas some really stellar, one of a kind visuals that make it a worthwhile watch anyway.Kind of shocked this isn’t more of a cult film tbh… get this playing in the Alamo."
dorysief,pathology,Pathology,2008,2025-10-09,3.0,"Pretty great concept for a horror/thriller movie, but I wish it spent more time on the creative kills and less on the characters having sex and smoking crack. Thankfully, the character dynamics are entertaining enough that it mostly works anyway. No idea why Catherine’s sole character trait was being gay for Gwen though (beyond the obvious)"
dorysief,werewolves-within,Werewolves Within,2021,2025-10-08,3.0,"The humor in this isveryhit or miss, but it’s fun enough for what it is. Solid cast. Ending goes on a bit too long though."
dorysief,ginger-snaps-back-the-beginning,Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning,2004,2025-10-07,2.0,You’ve gotta be at least five movies deep into your horror franchise before pulling something like this.It’s an unnecessary prequel set in the early 1900s? After setting up a decently compelling cliffhanger in the previous film?? And the plot is just a retread of the firstGinger Snapswith less interesting versions of the main characters???ANDit feels five hours long despite only being an hour and a half???? Come on.
dorysief,ginger-snaps-2-unleashed,Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed,2004,2025-10-07,3.5,"Not sure how I feel about some of the decisions made in the last act, but overall I enjoyed this a lot more than I was expecting to. Brigitte‘s constant war with her own changing body serves as a nice parallel to Ginger’s in the first film, and I’m glad they found a way to bring Katharine Isabelle back even if she felt a bit underutilized. Tatiana Maslany is really great in this too."
dorysief,ginger-snaps,Ginger Snaps,2000,2025-10-07,4.0,"I love Letterboxd. It’s so funny to look back at what I thought of this movie nine years ago and see that I thought the ending dragged??? The ending is the best part!!!I’m not completely sold on the final werewolf design here, but the transformation is really gnarly (positive) and the coming of age story well executed. Really love the changing dynamic between Brigitte and Ginger throughout the film.🐺"
dorysief,are-we-good-2025,Are We Good?,2025,2025-10-05,4.0,"Lots of sweaty shirts and sagging pants. Works best when it’s a melancholic love story. Not fond of mustacheless Maron.My biggest critique here is that a lot of the hardest hitting moments come directly from Maron’s Instagram lives and his podcast, so I imagine if you’ve religiously kept up with both over the past five years the film may not work as well for you."
dorysief,freaks-of-nature,Freaks of Nature,2015,2025-10-04,3.0,"More comedy than it is horror but that's ok, it has some fun moments. Keegan-Michael Key and Bob Odenkirk both have fun scenes but ultimately Mackenzie Davis carries the whole thing. I always forget how much I like her until I watch another movie/show she's in.Completely unrelated to anything, but this also may be the only fictional movie that references Odyssey of the Mind?? Certainly the only one I've seen (don’t fact check me on this)."
dorysief,natural-born-killers,Natural Born Killers,1994,2025-10-03,2.5,no other movie has ever looked like this and it’s likely no other movie will ever look like this again (not sure if this is positive or negative)it is kind of funny for Tarantino to write a movie about how America is obsessed with violence tho
dorysief,good-boy-2025,Good Boy,2025,2025-10-03,3.5,"Really great dog acting in this. I mean, he’s no Messi (ofAnatomy of a Fallfame), but he totally carries this movie. The horror narrative was kind of lacking for me, but it’s hard not to be impressed by the whole thing regardless. Big fan of the documentary segment explaining how they made the movie after the credits."
dorysief,untraceable,Untraceable,2008,2025-10-03,3.0,"like an elongated, R-rated episode of CSI or NCIS or whatever. I admittedly multitasked while I watched it. kids - don't download suspicious horse game links!!"
dorysief,the-invitation-2015,The Invitation,2015,2025-10-03,3.5,"Pretty good! Can definitely predict where it’s going pretty early on (likely by design), but it’s well executed enough to be interesting. Good performances. Good ending scene."
dorysief,wet-hot-american-summer,Wet Hot American Summer,2001,2025-09-30,3.5,"Some of it works, some of it doesn’t. It’s fun for what it is."

dorysief,talk-radio,Talk Radio,1988,2025-09-30,3.5,"Started this yesterday morning and finished it just now, which unfortunately probably did the movie’s pacing a disservice. Nonetheless, it’s impressive just how tense and interesting this movie can be considering the majority of it is a radio show with an unlikable host. Pretty great ending too. Feels surprisingly relevant to the modern day."
dorysief,one-battle-after-another,One Battle After Another,2025,2025-09-29,3.0,"Kind of a nothingburger of a movie for me. This is a film that’s “political” in the sense that politics are significant to the characters, but what’s being said is so surface level that it ultimately just feels like set dressing for a mediocre action thriller. The characters all feel cartoonishly one note with underdeveloped relationships to each other, and the writing is pretty lackluster for a PTA film.Genuinely don’t know if I would’ve made it past the first…"
dorysief,dead-of-winter-2025,Dead of Winter,2025,2025-09-29,2.5,"Sure, whatever.The flashback love story here kind of feels like an unnecessary narrative crutch for what could’ve been a more thrilling ..thriller."
dorysief,a-minecraft-movie,A Minecraft Movie,2025,2025-09-27,1.5,I’ve never played Minecraft and Jack Black is kinda insufferable

dorysief,the-imaginarium-of-doctor-parnassus,The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus,2009,2025-09-26,1.5,"Strange movie. I like some of what it’s doing narratively and visually but, for the most part, it feels like its overarching themes of choice and personal desire take a backseat to the over-the-top dream sequences. Feels more style than substance most of the time.I think it’s admirable that Gillam managed to work the fact that his lead actor (Ledger) died mid-way through production into the film’s narrative… but Tony and Valentina’s romantic/sexual subplot is ultimately just kind of…"
dorysief,switch,Switch,1991,2025-09-24,3.0,"Early last year I watched the failed pilot of a TV show with basically the same plot as this movie but starring Will Arnett and Rhea Seehorn as the central character. Allegedly it was close to being picked up, but the showrunners were too conflicted on what this cishet man turned woman’s sexuality would be... which is a shame because I would’ve happily watched ten seasons of Rhea Seehorn sauntering around as a chauvinistic womanizer trapped in the body of…"
dorysief,i-like-movies,I Like Movies,2022,2025-09-23,5.0,one of the best movies of all time.
dorysief,walt-disney-world-resort-in-florida-holiday-guide-video,Walt Disney World Resort In Florida Holiday Guide Video,1998,2025-09-23,,"this is a guide video from the UK and they make sure to mention that the drinking age in the US is 21 and they're ""very strict!!"" about it. unfortunately that's pretty much the only interesting thing here."
dorysief,rachel-bloom-death-let-me-do-my-special,"Rachel Bloom: Death, Let Me Do My Special",2024,2025-09-23,2.5,"Always kind of a bummer to log a stand up special by a performer I generally like and not be able to tag it with my laugh tag. A lot of this is just kind of sad, and the songs/jokes aren't really funny or well written enough to counter the harsher realities brought up. ""She's not psychic, she just has Amazon Prime"" is a good line though, and I liked some of the ghost song."
dorysief,the-history-of-sound,The History of Sound,2025,2025-09-22,3.0,"yeah, that’s about what I expected…I kind of feel like I’ve seen this exact same tragic gay movie 500 times now but the scenes of the two of them collecting folk songs were pretty cool, and the ending scene is nice. whatever, man."
dorysief,girls-best-friend,Girl's Best Friend,2008,2025-09-22,3.5,Cute movie with a cute dog. Probably wouldn’t have worked as well without Janeane Garofalo as the lead.
dorysief,living-in-oblivion,Living in Oblivion,1995,2025-09-20,3.5,the first bit is basically a documentary
dorysief,american-pastoral,American Pastoral,2016,2025-09-18,2.0,"Admittedly don’t really know what to do with this.This is a film that ostensibly has something to say about politics and/or America… but I can’t say I know what that is exactly. A handful of well acted scenes, particularly towards the start of the film, but the writing and presentation of the story feel lacking. Apparently this is better executed in the source novel?? Either way, I’m particularly not a fan of the framing narrative / narration. It feels…"
dorysief,tell-me-who-i-am,Tell Me Who I Am,2019,2025-09-17,3.5,"Really tough watch. The central conceit is an absolutely impossible moral dilemma, and the documentary does its best to illustrate why both men felt the way they did about their unique situations in a way that does not cast judgement on either of them.After an accident, Alex has lost nearly all of the memories of his life and has to rely entirely on his twin brother, Marcus, to fill in the missing pieces...but Marcus knows that their shared past…"
dorysief,project-mkhexe,Project MKHEXE,2025,2025-09-16,2.0,"“Is that some kinda ripoff of MKUltra?”I really like the premise and faux documentary set-up of this film, but it is far far too long for what it is. Unfortunately pretty boring, with the majority of the “horror” being glitchy shaky cam and off-screen violence. Also just kind of goes in logic circles with regard to the MKHEXE footage being completely wiped/deleted versus suddenly, inexplicably available in some form so that it can be shown in the doc."

dorysief,twin-peaks-fire-walk-with-me,Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me,1992,2025-09-14,3.5,"Some really stand-out scenes in this, but it wasn’t as emotionally affecting for me as it seems to have been for so many others. The opening thirty or so minutes is obviously related to Laura’s story, but I think I would’ve liked the film more as a whole had it been a bit more narrowly focused. Still a pretty great end to the original run of the series though. The scenes of Laura and Donna are the best bits and made me like Donna far more than I did in the show."
dorysief,kpop-demon-hunters,KPop Demon Hunters,2025,2025-09-13,2.0,"I have so many questions about the lore of this world but I fear the majority of them would sound nitpicky so I’ll just say… no aspect of this was For Me. The story feels rushed, and the songs all sounded pretty generic.I think this probably would’ve worked a bit better as a series, where the characters and the world they live in could’ve been better established."

Unfortunately, unlike Kevin Smith, James Robinson isn’t great at writing women. Or, at least, younger women - Mrs. Cresswell is fine.Still a fun little comic-fueled crime movie though.

There's a couple of funny moments in this adaptation that don't exist in any of the others (particularly liked the woman who killed someone with a knife reading the 'How to Properly Use Knives' chapter of an etiquette book), but it focuses far too much on Amos for my liking.

Kind of a fun concept (actors are mistaken for real bandits when the bandits steal their clothes) but the execution isn't great. They're just kind of running around until their interpreter can clear things up for them.
dorysief,lonesome,Lonesome,1928,2025-05-25,3.5,"Really beautiful movie. It feels inaccurate to call it experimental, but some of the editing effects and pops of color are incredibly well done and artful. It reminds me of playing around with different plug-ins and image overlays in an editing program - though obviously the people making this didn't have anything near that kind of technology (and yet it still looks incredible). Also really enjoyed seeing the fair footage, especially the old timey rollercoaster. The story is nothing special, and that's why I'm not rating this any higher, but the connection between the two protagonists is sweet nonetheless."

Mark Ruffalo in particular is just hard to watch - what I assume has to be the worst performance of his career - and I’m not big on the voice Robert Pattinson is doing as the title character either."

Don't get me wrong, the kill concepts in this one are still a ton of fun - love the coaster opening - but I actually care about what happens to the characters as well.(Ignoring ridiculous exchanges like ""SpongeBob lives underwater"" / ""It's so sad that you know that..."" - or maybe that's just a part of the movie's charm)"

It’s still entertaining, but the actual kills feel farther apart and the mystery of how “death’s design” works isn’t as intriguing when it’s already been played out before in a similar fashion."
dorysief,final-destination,Final Destination,2000,2025-05-13,3.5,"Undeniably fun. I think it’s a little harder to appreciate after five (soon to be six) installments, but this has such a great original premise.

dorysief,down-with-love,Down with Love,2003,2025-05-10,3.5,"If you were to consider this film based on its script alone, I think it would add up to be a largely forgettable romcom, but the costume design, set design, and editing come together to create something wholly unique.

It is, at times, funny though (I think, intentionally so!) so…at least there’s that.There’s a scene in this where a blind woman plays a voice memo and it’s extremely sped up and the protagonist is like “I can’t understand this” and she explains that blind people can hear things quickly like how seeing people can sight read a page without reading every word.

It does feel like the tension between the three protagonists is solved a little too quickly at the end, but it’s a very nice movie particularly for the time it was made. Really love the scene between the dad and Simon.I’m curious how the remake will play with the dynamic, as it’s pretty pivotal to the plot (and its conflicts) that the woman being married is a straight woman in need of a green card - neither of which seem to be the case in the 2025 film."

Not a big fan of the nearly greyscale color palette, and I felt like I spent the entire first half of the movie desperately trying to catch up on what exactly was going on in the film’s world rather than being able to appreciate its characters and their dynamic.

Jack Quaid is very likable in the lead role, and Matt Walsh (not that one) is a master at delivering his limited dialogue in a way that maximizes its humor. Action movies aren’t really my thing, but I think they’re generally better when the fights are over-the-top and cartoonish like these. Lots of sprayed blood, unconventional weapons, and thudding sound effects. Good time at the movie theater."
dorysief,spaceballs,Spaceballs,1987,2025-03-07,3.5,"I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about this one, but was pleasantly surprised by it. A lot of broad, silly comedy that works not only because of funny writing but because of just how endearing its characters are. Barf’s tail wags and ear movement are good examples of things that are (almost) consistently “cute” that aren’t necessarily necessary for the comedy or plot but which make his character, and the movie, all the more likable. Also a fan of theAlienscene, even if it feels tacked on for the sake of the gag and not much more.Good, dumb fun!"

Really enjoyed the animation style, particularly the sketchy backgrounds that the characters melted into. Not too fond of Tiger’s voice actor, but otherwise a pretty solid short animation with a lot of promise."
dorysief,alice-heart,Alice-Heart,2025,2025-03-06,2.5,"Charming enough indie drama that wears its inspirations on its sleeves - and, more literally, on its walls …in the form of movie posters.Unfortunately the girlfailure protagonist and black and white cinematography easily invites comparison toFrances Ha, and its script is nowhere near as strong as its predecessor.Props for being one of the more likable mumblecore films to come out in recent years though."
dorysief,40-watts-from-nowhere,40 Watts from Nowhere,2025,2025-03-06,3.0,Pretty cool in-depth look at a pirate radio station that operated out of California. Unfortunately I think it’s a little too long for the amount of material it has - it could’ve probably even been a 30-40 minute short - but the interviews are fun and the film as a whole is a nice little window into a short-lived niche subculture.

The voice acting also kind of annoyed me. The whole thing kind of has the vibe of a kid on YouTube playing with Littlest Pet Shop toys and narrating, just with original figures instead of LPS."

Loved when it got a little quirky with it (Alison Pill’s train car + Tilda Swinton’s whole thing), but the slow mo action scenes often did nothing for me and the end was a little too explanatory for my liking.

Did not help that it quickly became a love triangle thing. Oh well.Watched on tubi on my flatscreen tv while eating wings, which made me think of how surreal and unbelievable that set up would’ve been to the people who made the film. Clara Bow didn’t even live to see the VHS, but I can see her movie streamed in 1080p, interrupted with commercials for modern medications. Crazy."

Almost makes me want to go back and finishOrphan Black. Almost."

Unfortunately, that gut instinct was correct. While this has a few stand out funny scenes, it is far too long for what it is.They Came Togetheris SNL Digital Short material, or Funny or Die material, …definitely not feature length movie material.Shout out to Melanie Lynskey hosting a Halloween party dressed as a vampire though. 10/10."

The romance worked better for the plot than I imagined though, and I still think the concept of setting a movie in one of these fake war cities is interesting.Kind of underutilized Chloë Sevigny and Tim Heidecker.

The “monkey” (chimp) was unironically a great decision, as was the choice to never acknowledge the fact that he’s a chimp throughout the movie. Beyond the unique protagonist choice, it follows a pretty standard music biopic formula, but it’s still a movie that’s as fun as it is (surprisingly!) emotionally moving. Amazing visuals too.

An edge of your seat moral dilemma drama with a solid cast and good pacing. Maybe it helped that I knew very little about the film going in, making its basic plot feel like a fun “twist.”Very funny though that there’s a moment where Toni Collette's character googles ‘[another character’s name]’s husband’ and literally every result is photos of the correct people.

Cool movie."

How are you wasting Susan Sarandon and Christine Baranski??"
dorysief,better-watch-out,Better Watch Out,2016,2024-11-21,2.5,This is...fine? I didn't hate it anyway. The twist is probably the most interesting aspect of the film ...but then it keeps going for another 60 minutes.

This didn’t move me emotionally to the degree ofMary & Max- I think, ironically, because the amount of horrific things happening was a littletoomuch - but I enjoyed it regardless.

I guess I can't blame him for being so quickly disarmed by Keira Knightley though...Laggiesis pretty simple, and honestly feels like a hundred movies I've seen before, but its cast usually makes up for its predictable story beats.

dorysief,dream-scenario,Dream Scenario,2023,2023-12-03,3.5,"Fun and unique concept for a movie, presumably based on theThis Manmeme/event. It’s darkly funny, and has some great cinematography, but I’m not sure how much I liked its eventual hard lean into the cancel culture angle. It definitely works for the story they’re telling - it’s not executed poorly or anything - but I thought it kind of watered down the promising premise to being something that’s kind of become overdone in media of all types."
dorysief,may-december,May December,2023,2023-12-02,4.0,"Uncomfortably captivating.It’s kind of genius and ironic to have a film like this be loosely based on an actual relationship. It’s a commentary on the adaptation of real peoples’ trauma and complexities while simultaneously (to some extent) being what it criticizes - but in a way that somehow works. You can revel in its drama, but it only leaves a discomforting and bittersweet aftertaste by the time the credits roll."

For every interesting scene/plot development there was another that made me wish the film was significantly shorter. ...like, Jay and Ralph's plotlines added to the film's central thesis in significant ways, but I don't know that the helicopter trip needed to be that long? Among other things. Al Pacino was really great though."

It failed to make me truly invest in any of its characters, failed at any meaningful kind of class commentary, and feels pretty uninspired when viewed as nothing more than a “shocking” twist thriller. The performances by Rosamund Pike, Richard E. Grant, and (briefly) Carey Mulligan are pretty fun though, and help to make up for the lackluster script."

The echoes of the original films/books just gives their narratives even more weight."

Who is revealed to be bisexual and having affairs (that the accused claims her husband largely knew about) during the course of the trial?Ironically, this fictional story has less engaging twists and turns than its real life counterpart. The addition of a blind child witness conflicted about the true nature of his father’s death is definitely interesting though, and his arc ended up being the best part of the film for me."

As I said in my first review (years ago now...) the ads do get a bit annoying towards the end of the movie, but I appreciate the feeling of authenticity throughout. All of the commercials feel like they really could be low budget local commercials, and the writing for the newscasters is similarly pitch perfect. It feels a lot more tongue-in-cheek and playful when compared to the better knownGhostwatch, and I appreciate it for that."

He’s still a killer doll, obviously, and that’s still funny at times, but this first film is way more grounded in a kind of twisted version of our reality.

It's not until the last third that it actually delves into the angle promised by its title/description (i.e. what it was like to grow up ""with Chucky"").

It's an interesting look at the no wave world Jean-Michel Basquiat was a part of through a fictionalized lens, but once it starts focusing on music performances it feels like it becomes more of a weird concert film than anything else.

Primarily because of the rudimentary animation style, but the attempts at “emotion” also just feel pretty at odds with the specific brand of comedy being employed in the rest of the film. The extended action sequences are similarly a chore to get through.There’s definitely a good basic concept here, and a clearly skilled cast. Just didn’t all come together. Also Twitchy is annoying."

Even though I’m sure every joke was rehearsed and prepared long before this special, it all feels very off the cuff and random in a way that rarely lands for me.The best bits were consistently the documentary sequences, which had some cute/funny anecdotes. Never felt that those segments ever truly gelled with the stand-up though."

I was expecting something more in-line withFrances Ha's depiction of a directionless adult character.

Unfortunately, she’s kinda bad live!FROOT (as an album) fared the best in terms of live performances here. Probably because they’re slower songs.

Admittedly this film took a little bit of a hit for me for reasons outside of its control (Hulu kept stuttering and crashing) but it has a pretty likable cast of characters, a banging soundtrack, and a good heart.

dorysief,bev,Bev,2016,2022-05-11,3.5,"There’s such a casualness about dark, traumatic memories here that works so well as melancholic comedy. The lead actor’s awkward, apprehensive delivery helps to make the character of Bev feel realistically sad and closed off rather than threatening or creepy - a fine line that definitely could have been crossed in the wrong hands.Not sure that the pageant nightmares work super well for me in short form. They definitely could have been pushed a little further even here, but ultimately I think they’d work better all around as a reoccurring motif in a series."

Keanu’s acting, and some of the hand to hand combat, is a bit stiff and goofy, but it actually works here in a charming sort of way. Sort of like howFace/Offworksbecauseof how over the top it is.On top of this charm,The Matrixhas the additional benefit of just looking really Cool. A lot of the shots and special effects are amazing, even when dated, and the costume design is instantly iconic.This isn’t something I have any deep feelings or affection for, but I had a good time."

As the film went on though I started to get bored with it. I generally cared about Durham more than I did Maurice and the film clearly did not agree with me on that.

Every bit is animated in a different style fitting the joke’s tone too, which is cool. As a stand-up routine it’s pretty good too. It has a bit of a rough start, and not all of the jokes land, but it’s generally pretty funny and enjoyable.Curious what Jenny Slate thinks of this if she’s seen it."

It’s cute enough though, and cool to have one of these generic cutesy anime relationships that’s also gay. The conversation Yamada has with her friend about meeting new people and having new experiences for the rest of your life is one of the better moments in the film both narratively and in terms of its animation."

Parker Posey's acting is jarringly false and over the top here but I can't say I blame her too much given some of the fantastical elements at play.Happy Tearsis a movie that is clearly personal for its director, if not for its subject matter than certainly for its inherent connection to his artist father, but one that ultimately seems lost and confused in its execution.

The ending montage of moments that happened over a 20 minute time period (for the viewer) and presumably week or so long period (in film) is probably the most egregious moment in this respect, though the scoring certainly doesn’t help.

Contrary to popular opinion though I actually liked this version of the story slightly more. The human element and Obayashi’s charming visual style / effects help to add a layer of likability to the film that the anime lacks.

With no personal stake in whether these men live or die the film isn’t nearly as tense as it should be and a lot of the sequences of them walking around the woods and shooting things just become a bore.At least now I can watch the Alien v Predator movies and root for the xenomorphs. #GirlPower"

Wasn't really into the romance angle, but I can’t quite say I disliked seeing the movie play out either. The “white girl goes to India and finds herself” sequences were thankfully pretty few and far between.…I don’t know! Guess it was pretty good even if I’m not completely sold on it at the moment."

I wish I liked it more. There are some stand-out scenes but for the most part I was just…bored. Which is sort of crazy given the premise. Cute puppy in this one tho.

I actually like it better than some of their later stuff. (namelyNo CountryandBurn After Reading... sorry) It may not be as technically polished as those later entries, and there are some lulls in the pacing of its storytelling, but the dialogue, acting, and concept here are all pretty great and help make up for its faults."

It’s a pretty solid superhero film, with characters that feel more complex than the Avengers that were being born into their own cinematic universe at the same time. Some of the graphics have definitely become dated over time - the diamond woman’s first transformation made me gasp at how bad it was - but those dated graphics also give the film some charm. Even more charming…"

The camaraderie between displaced outcasts is replaced with simplified satirizations of office life and corporate greed, leaving the viewer with a film that is occasionally fun but nonetheless empty in terms of character and emotion. This lack of heart could work for a fun, schlocky horror comedy.. but that would require the…"

What trailers made out to be a pretty bland, derivative looking horror movie from James Wan - who’s been playing it safe with the Conjuring films these past few years - turned out to be an insane, no-holds-barred rollercoaster of a horror film. No, it’s not scary or even all that thrilling, but it is pretty funny.. and equally as…"

The satirical look at stardom and the media's obsession with tragedy and the macabre is spot-on and often very funny. The ""heterophobia"" from Aunt Ida is also fun in a tongue in cheek way, particularly knowing the time period this came out in. The graphic sexuality in relation to young teens (even if they were portrayed by obviously older adults) sort of pushed the line for…"

dorysief,the-protege,The Protégé,2021,2021-09-09,2.0,"Watched for (Themed) Gorge ||7/??The Protégéhas a pretty fantastic cast, but squanders any of its potential with a bland, generic narrative and occasionally cringey dialogue, with none of the fun visual flair of something likeAtomic Blonde. It’s similarly underwhelming and messy in its attempts at any kind of emotion or character development.Strange to me that they decided to include clips in the trailer that ended up inadvertently revealing a major twist."

As it ended I was left uncertain about what I had just seen and reading a few theories on its possible meaning left me largely unsatisfied. Maybe it’s not meant to have one concrete meaning - style over substance and all - but in that case I can’t say I got much out of the largely contextless viewing experience. The audio levels in particular are…

The opening is a fun set-up to the universe, setting aside it's strangely identityless typography, and I liked the protagonists well enough even if they were a bit underdeveloped but this is ultimately just too overlong with not enough going on in its bloated runtime that interests me.When it comes to the film's emotional coreArmy of the Deadruns into a…"

I've seen quite a few people on Twitter calling the story too overbearing and explanatory, particularly in terms of its dialogue about social issues, but it didn't really feel that way to me. Yeah, a lot of the themes are plainly stated, but the…"
dorysief,vacation-friends,Vacation Friends,2021,2021-08-28,2.5,this is pretty much exactly what you’d expect from the premise. mindless summer comedy movie with lots of predictable jokes and over the top antics with a quickly resolved ending. glad meredith hagner is getting that coin tho.
dorysief,prom-wars-love-is-a-battlefield,Prom Wars: Love Is a Battlefield,2008,2021-08-27,2.0,This is one of the few movies that I think would genuinely be better if it had been restricted to a PG-13 rating instead of an R. It’s actually kind of baffling that it isn’t aiming for a younger demographic because its plot seems custom made for a preteen/teen audience. As it stands though the final film is some weird combination of 2000’s comedy and Wes Anderson-wannabe prep school characters. Also Phil of the Future is here. …uh. yeah.
dorysief,the-kid-detective,The Kid Detective,2020,2021-08-27,3.5,"I was surprised by just how much I enjoyed this! The premise feels a little silly in concept, but its serious performances matched well with its darkly humorous writing and helped to set a good tone for its dark ending note. The clues dropped throughout the film make it fun to try and unravel the core mystery, but aren’t obvious enough to make its solution an easy guess.The little world building moments and townspeople quirks are some of my favorite scenes.. love the gang leader with the peanut allergy where the pat down to see him includes confiscating any peanut candy."

dorysief,cult-of-chucky,Cult of Chucky,2017,2021-08-25,2.0,"Cult of Chuckyis absolutely bonkers. Certainly more reserved thanBrideorSeed, but it nonetheless feels like a complete tonal departure from its most recent predecessor,Curse of Chucky. As much as I'm glad that the absurdity has been injected back into the franchise with this installment, however, I can't say I was completely on-board with its madcap narrative or its uncomfortable displays of psychiatric abuse in what is largely a comedic horror film. I am a fan of posessed!Nica and Tiffany though...wish that that concept had played a bigger role in the film."
dorysief,the-night-house,The Night House,2020,2021-08-21,3.5,"Not entirely sold on the ending here - I think the ambiguity works up to a point, but there are a few too many loose threads that don't entirely make sense to me personally.

The writing and mystery of the film's first half are really…"
dorysief,bunion,Bunion,2014,2021-08-20,2.5,Bunionis competently shot and has the benefit of having some good performers in its cast but its narrative feels so aggressively average - particularly the ending note. Also you never see the bunion (lame)
dorysief,the-naked-king-what-a-beautiful-life,The Naked King: What a Beautiful Life,2021,2021-08-20,2.5,I was kind of underwhelmed by this short in spite of its stellar animation and character design. It feels like a teaser for an anime series rather than a one-off short - there’s just too much story for the less than five minute runtime. The protagonist being gay feels especially glossed over given its apparent relevance to the short’s rushed plot. The only explicit reference to his homosexuality I can parse is the pink triangle collar - and even that’s sort of blink and you’ll miss it.Ultimately a case of a decent idea with good art but poor narrative execution.

It’s unfortunately a little overstuffed, skimming over sections of Franklin’s life through sheer necessity, but it’s a pretty solid biopic that manages to adequately address her home life, activism, and career."
dorysief,dont-breathe-2,Don't Breathe 2,2021,2021-08-14,2.0,"Even as a so-called “anti-villain” The Blind Man just ultimately does not work as a co-protagonist following the events of the first film. His actions were too depraved then, and his representation here is far too sympathetic - even if they do vaguely address his former actions in dialogue. To counteract his misdeeds they’ve added a new cast of characters who are almost cartoonishly evil in their motivations. They unsurprisingly do not work, and the movie becomes more laughable than…"

It certainly helps that the taxes she’s so hellbent on collecting are from a rich, tax evading multi-business owner who mercilessly evicts struggling families. Small moments of character development (like the call with her son vs her conversation with Gondo’s son) also help to make her a well rounded character.The repetitive score kind of drives me crazy though.

It's brilliantly acted, with Ed Oxenbould really carrying the film's emotion, but from a narrative standpoint I just don't know that it really adds anything to the table. The story of a dysfunctional family and, by extension, a crumbling marriage, has been done a hundred times over at this point and there's nothing here inWildlifethat's different or gripping enough for me to have any strong feelings about it.

The twist feels a little out of left field, leaning into shock value. The short was dark before that but less.. aggressively so. Basically, I don't think we need to see the images of the characters with their pants pulled down to Understand what was happening. It's very on the nose when compared to the wolf metaphor. Happy for that little boy and his new sheep family though."

The visuals really are a sight to behold though. The super-saturated colors and cartoonish bloodsplatter are particularly great and make this well worth a watch even for those not as thrilled with samurai/revenge films (like me 😳).

The film’s insistence on autonomy and independence for its protagonist with down syndrome also feels like an important step forward in representation. Memorable little indie drama."

The latter sequences almost feel unscripted, painting a nice portrait of some of the sentiments of the 90's lesbian scene in and around the filmmakers' area. It's a bit reminiscent ofThe Watermelon Womanand, perhaps even moreso, Cheryl Dunye's early…"

It would have been cool to actually see and hear more of the actual words of the film's dissenters to see how wild their arguments got but I assume there just wasn't much footage of the protestors to work with.

There weren’t. References are just endlessly thrown at the viewer and absolutely none of them are the slightest bit humorous.

Rick Moranis is also here, in addition to a young Willem Dafoe, which is fun.

Whereas the first film had some heart, as well as some clear call backs to the chipmunks’ origins, this one just feels so empty of...well, anything really. It’s a mindless going through the motions of a CGI / Live-Action hybrid children’s film, filled to the brim with chipmunkified pop song covers.

It's definitely more grounded and has a more simplistic story than a lot of the stuff Ghibli has put out before and after it, but it's a well-done movie with a great cast of characters. The ending feels a bit lackluster in terms of wrapping things up, but overall it's a good time."

I read another review here that described this as ""Frances Habut if the characters were hornier and perpetually drunk,"" and that's a pretty good summary of it even if the writing is never really up to par withFrances Ha. The wardrobe department kinda went off here."

dorysief,memorable,Memorable,2019,2021-01-24,4.0,"A lot of films attempt to depict the deterioration of the mind with age, but few that do are as visually impactful asMemorable. The changing styles of the stop motion figures work incredibly well to represent the increasingly abstract real life figures in the protagonist's life. The final sequence is one of the best, perfectly capturing a half finished painterly style that miraculously works in the world of three-dimensional figures."

dorysief,playground-2017,Playground,2017,2021-01-24,3.5,"This is cute, and thankfully never tries to be something it's not. There's no air of seriousness or pretention, just a man working through the loss of his brother with the help of some neighborhood kids ""kidnapping"" him.I see a few reviews here mention wanting it to be longer, but I think the short form works well for the subject. It could definitely have a bit more of an emotional impact with further character development, but at its core it's a pretty simplistic concept and I think we know as much as we need to for the film to work."
dorysief,american-waste,American Waste,2019,2021-01-24,3.0,"I feel like the narrative of this short could have been a bit better told in a feature. As is, it feels like there’s a few too many elements at play and not enough time to really establish the characters and their relationships well enough for its ending note to make an impact. The acting is also a bit lackluster, particularly in some of the junkyard scenes. Really nice visuals and aesthetics though, and I like the general idea and themes the short explores."

The characters are all a bit off-kilter with their individual quirks laid out by the short’s narration, but the script never really feels like it’s mocking them for these quirks. There’s certainly bits meant to be darkly humorous but these moments, more often than not, poke fun at society and unfortunate situations moreso than they do the characters themselves. The animation style, character design, and sets perfectly match the short’s simultaneously dark and whimsical tone and easily endear the viewer to its big-eared and wide-eyed protagonist."

If I'm honest, it probably could have used a little bitmorehorror ..and a little bit less of the erratic editing. The ending does attempt to make up for the elongated exposition though, and I'm thankful for it. Lots of last minute twists and rash decisions always makes for a fun time."
dorysief,the-maker-2011,The Maker,2011,2021-01-22,3.0,"I love the character design in this. It's a very different aesthetic from the creatures inAllure, by the same director, but it works perfectly for the short. The human teeth in particular give the characters a weird, eerie edge to their otherwise friendly, rounded figures. I'm not sure I'm totally on board with the execution of the concept here, but it's definitely a unique idea and I like what it's going for."
dorysief,allure-2014,Allure,2014,2021-01-22,3.0,"This has some cute critter designs. I especially like the way they blink.

I think it mostly works for me.

What does elevate it beyond its typical genre conventions are its lead performances from Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis, and its incredibly quotable script.

Unfortunately I found it pretty hard to get into. Although the start of the film definitely has its moments, a lot of it plays out like the love child of an after school special and an early Lifetime original.

The (imperfect) subversion of the femme fatale archetype as a male character, Karan, is pretty interesting, but there’s not much else to write home about here.

Its main character is irredeemable and manipulative, but it’s nonetheless fun to watch her as she continuously tries to figure out how to manage her ever-evolving string of lies.The ending is a bit anticlimactic, all things considered, but overall it’s an entertaining (though stressful) watch and a very unique character study."

It's also a bizarre little French animation wherein mafia henchmen are capturing cyclists for a gambling-based set up in which the kidnapped cyclists race in a simulated Tour de France.

Unfortunately, in spite of a pretty strong opening, any emotional resonance the film/characters have is pretty much thrown out the window when it introduces things like giant Godzilla-like turtles and bat/cat vampires.

It’s not a masterpiece by any means but it’s easily entertaining and, underneath all of the campy glitz and glam, has an interesting premise and overall concept of the future that lightheartedly pokes fun at the hippie movement while putting forth some progressive ideas about female sexuality. I personally would have liked to see a bit more of a concrete plot for something like this, and more use out of Anita Pallenberg as The Great Tyrant, but overall it’s a good time."

As odd as it is that something likeAliceis the predecessor to Scorsese’s more universally-known films however, I ended up liking it quite a bit. It’s an incredibly charming drama with some easily likable protagonists. The dynamic between Alice and Tommy in particular is a fun one, and really helps to drive the film’s simplistic narrative."

It has a somewhat decent, if generic, soundtrack, actors that range from mediocre to bad, and a basic plot structure that's been done a hundred times prior - especially in sports movies.

Better writing thanBridget Jonesstill isn't saying much though, and it's unsurprising to find that this was written and directed by a straight man.

Zoey Deutch is great in the lead role, fast-talking the audience into liking her as much as she fast-talks the people around her into believing in her schemes.Also I think that Hollywood should be casting Judy Greer in significantly more roles than they are."

It’s understandable that an aging actress’s young fan dying in front of her -becauseof her, no less - would have a lasting effect, and, for the most part, the narrative is effective in showing the character’s downward spiral as she’s confronted with literal mortality and the more metaphorical death of her youth.

The animation is amazing, especially knowing it was done by one person, and the character designs are adorable but the story itself is sort of overdone and the audio/dialogue lacking.I feel like a lot of this short banks on the relatability of losing sight of your dreams with the added emotional pull of a cute and lovable animal couple.

Although I stupidly read reviews that led me to guess the ending twist a little over halfway into the film I still ended up enjoying everything that led up to it. I sort of wish it had ended differently, partially because I wish I had been surprised and partially because I liked the concept of the women teaming up to kill their abusive lover better than the inevitable actuality of the situation, but I don't really fault the film for that.The ending 'notice' not to tell your friends about what happened is cute."

dorysief,bitter-orange,Bitter Orange,2013,2016-04-14,2.0,"This short was made by artist/cartoonist Hope Larson so it's no surprise that it's exceptionally pretty to look at (with a poster to match) but it falls short in terms of story. Everything about this short feels rushed and unfinished and, as a result, what could make for a decent movie makes for a very lackluster short."

dorysief,megan-is-missing,Megan Is Missing,2011,2016-02-07,1.5,"The beginning of Megan is Missing is a prime example of everything not to do in a movie. It's simultaneously boring and over-the-top while obviously having been written by a 40 year old man.

And a surprisingly decent horror film as well.I loved the Cronenberg TV scene and the bug-eyed true form of the succubus. And Ernest R.

The hypnotic synth score and hazy, dreamlike quality in some scenes lend this a bit of an Italian horror vibe.

Creepy, stranded-on-an-island, Scooby-Doo meets Leatherface kinda vibes, with a hulking freak who crushes heads in his bare hands.

Gnarly green-eyed vengeance from beyond, served up with some delectably gruesome kills. The tone is utterly bonkers, feeling like a psychological thriller most of the time but occasionally exploding into some full-on 80s cheesetastic horror moments that approach almostEvil Dead IIlevels of crazy.

Maybe this suggests that Death by Lightning is great? But, it didn't feel like that.What it did remind me of was Steven Spielberg's Lincoln. The raucous and the reverent.

Personally, I found the film a real chore after the first 25 to 30 minutes. It has a threadbare plot, the curiously reanimating Macbeth spouting Basil Rathbone is a nice idea, but for 45 minutes it was beyond my tolerance. Vincent Price and Peter Lorre are an amusingly tall/short combo, but the film gives them no jokes. Boris Karloff Karloff's about, and Joyce Jameson sing opera and displays cleavage. A horror comedy that isn't funny, and barely begins to touch on horror. I found it quite tedious."

The rouge on your cheeks is dishonest. And a fat woman in a girdle - huh, that's highway robbery.""The Rage of Paris is a fun comedy. Every scene is made better by Danielle Darrieux. It is a truly great performance. She has a distinct ease with the screwball elements. But she brings something else to the film as well. She makes Douglas Fairbanks jr appealing by extension. The rest of the film isn't at her level, see Fairbanks jr, but you can't complain spending 78 minutes with Darrieux."

But, the…"

I thought they'd be the other way around.The documentary is a fun watch, even at 5 hours. But it is more anecdote than incisive. I don't think Rebecca Miller asks one interesting question about any of the films Scorsese made. She is quite intrigued by his childhood and his drug habit, but has only nominal interest in exploring his professional work."
dancedancedance,haunted-castle-1969,Haunted Castle,1969,2025-10-29,3.5,"A brilliantly filmed atmospheric horror film, which eschews any plot or character for lengthy scenes where a vengeful cat wreaks bloody revenge. The second half is slowing building horror and works as attack after attack, all while the soundtrack is a mix of screeching and unusual instrumentation. It is mostly staged in one setting, but the film does a lot with shadows, and camera angles, to be visually really interesting.Though, let's be honest, The Haunted Castle may look like a classy product, but it is a cat slasher."

A ghost story, that is precipitated by a double murder, which just gets more and more cruel from there. A film where every character is worse than the last, as they go through murder, sexual assault, and terror, all grasping for money and trying to escape vengeance. Vengeance that is passed on curse-like, as we end outside of the original perpetrators (to certain extent). It is brilliantly put together -…"

I don't think the film is perfect, or even great, but the negative reviews seem far-removed from the actual film.The film is thrilling, fast-paced, and procedural.

It played as a flat-out comedy to my Edinburgh audience. It felt like watching a Wes Anderson film at half-speed and underwater.The film feels like a frippery, a lark, compared with Reichardt's usually rigorous and emotional dramas.

It is a fascinating and evocative look at childhood, with classic French picaresque storytelling and a focus on incident rather than plot. It is redolent of every childhood, but very specific to 1976.

dancedancedance,the-fog,The Fog,1980,2025-09-18,5.0,"I know that the general consensus is that The Fog is mid-tier Carpenter between the twin highpoints of Halloween and The Thing, but give me Stevie Wayne and her lighthouse radio station beyond almost anything else in his filmography.Give me Antonio Bay and Tom Atkins. The camp fire ghost story and Hal Holbrook's priest. The convenience store, the petrol station, and steps down to the lighthouse. The luminous fog against John Carpenter's best theme music. Coastal horror is the best horror.I couldn't like the film more."
dancedancedance,hells-half-acre,Hell's Half Acre,1954,2025-09-17,3.5,"Hell's Half Acre is a really good Hawaii set noir where a woman, whose husband is declared missing in action after Pearl Harbor, conducts her own investigation into his disappearance.Wendell Corey is suitably odd as the potential missing husband, and there are local criminals, taxi dancing, and murders to contend with.The film is all played out against sliding Hawaiian musical accompaniment, and a cast that includes Elsa Lanchester (in a Hawaiian shirt) as a cab driver, Marie Windsor…"
dancedancedance,the-maltese-falcon,The Maltese Falcon,1931,2025-09-16,3.0,"I didn't hate this. Clearly, it isn't as good as the John Huston film from a decade later, but it has the bones of the Hammett story and a fair amount to enjoy. Not least Ricardo Cortez's smirking and more satanic Sam Spade. The dialogue is still amused with itself, and the pre-code sexiness gives it some extra frisson (mainly through Thelma Todd, and a scene in a bath). Quite fun, even while the Huston and Bogart films remains essential."
dancedancedance,back-to-the-wall,Back to the Wall,1958,2025-09-16,4.0,"A darkly amusing French crime film that posits would you blackmail your own wife if she looked like Jeanne Moreau and she is having an affair? The film is extremely watchable, from the silent murder that takes up the first 15 minutes with a tense set-piece, to the moments where Gérard Oury's plan of manipulation and blackmail drifts out of his control. A film of sexual jealousy and obsession without endpoint or reason. I like how Oury doesn't really have…"

The bleakest escape imaginable, bullfighting. Everything looks like rubble, or is rubble. Lots of fatherless young men, lots of violent petty crime, and the occasional trip to the river. The highlight is a stroll with friends, between crimes, and maybe a shared cigarette.The film is beautifully photographed and directed by Carlos Saura, and is filled with striking black and white imagery. It contrasts…"

Well, that was wrong because The Yellow Balloon is a brilliant film. A child's eye view of post-War crime and misery, much like Thompson's own Tiger Bay, but with an even leaner narrative and more general unease.Bombed out London is used really impressively, in that every single building looks like a total death trap. The whole…"
dancedancedance,phantom-thread,Phantom Thread,2017,2025-09-14,5.0,"Phantom Thread is a beguiling and intoxicating Paul Thomas Anderson film. It is quite unlike anything else he has done. It, again, looks at a relationship, somewhat abusive, between two characters, whose love manifests in way that healthy for neither. Anderson has Vicky Krieps decode and unravel Daniel Day Lewis' Reynolds Woodcock, finding more and more surface, until she doesn't and then the film swirls into something quite different. From the Daphne Du Maurier narrative, all the way to an…"

The second half of PTA's career is materially better than the first half.The vignette structure, which made it fade in and out like a great book of linked short stories; the time lapses, which make everything slightly hazy, the Max Ophuls-swoon of direction that opens the film (the best piece of PTA going full…"

Weird old England with its ghosts and frets and glue man. Wars and the Cornish coast; causeways and blessings in Canterbury. A marvellous trilogy that I watched without any thought of how they might connect.A Canterbury Tale is a wonderful Powell & Pressburger fantasia. The plot starts with a light mystery but is more interested in the countryside fields and unusual poetry of…"
dancedancedance,the-uninvited,The Uninvited,1944,2025-09-13,5.0,"The obvious touchstone for The Uninvited is Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca. The film combines the Cornish coast so beloved by Daphne Du Maurier and the setting for Rebecca, with a more overt sense of chills and ghostly mutterings. Though, it also has a surprisingly effective sense of humour, unlike Rebecca, and it even manages to end the film on a good mother-in-law joke. As rare as that sounds.The film itself wonderfully combines the atmospheric sense of a haunted house mystery,…"

This is the second time I have watched it, and I think it remains remarkable.Dread pervades, but it isn't overcooked, the setting is well captured and the acting well modulated. It is oddly beautiful, in a small-town way, with the marshes and sea fogs and rickety alleyways.Gothic and chilling, it is a dour film with a rather…"

I have a suspicion that Big Fish is a really good film, that is going to be the Burton critically reappraised.However, Sleepy Hollow is my favourite.A neo-Hammer horror that swerves into both the comedy and the horror. Johnny Depp has never been funnier. His Ichabod Crane is a delightful coward. He is superior, but sweet. Afraid of…"

It doesn't have Brief Encounter's elegant structure but instead settles on being a more brittle proposition. It is a tougher film, one where the characters are afforded less dignity, and voices are actually raised.It is another masterpiece in a directorial career littered with them. It is impossibly well crafted, and it is clearly one of the inspirations for modern-day masterpiece Phantom Thread. It has a sickly quality,…"

It is a stark two-hander that shares quite a lot with 3:10 to Yuma.Produced by Robert Aldrich, the film has a hard-edge, and treats you to some unusual touches. The Mexican characters actually speak in Spanish. The film is shot by Aldrich regular Joseph F. Biroc and has a menacing quality. It is a brisk 80 minutes with a nice…"

It is quite poorly directed, as it shuffles through its post-war mystery of adultery and murder.It has atmosphere and a few really good scenes. I always find Ladd…"

A film of obscene phone calls, a DJ looking like Prowse, Sal Mineo's body, all sorts of psychological trauma and unease, and noirish dialogue that might not know it verges on parodic.Sleazy, hard-edged, and unpleasant, but with a 1950s sensibility smuggled into the 1960s.

The big set-piece is the authentification of a stamp. A British crime film, which at least nods at the American film noir aesthetic, has a intriguing plot -21-year-old Melissa Collins (Eileen Elton) commits suicide, her guardian, the domineering American newspaper publisher William T.

She is variously bursting out of her buttoned shirt, or swanning about in a bikini.Peter Cushing, on the other hand, probably enjoyed making this film more than anything he made. His whole performance is sitting in a pub, drinking bitter, and not speaking. He just saunters down the Swan…"

It is a beautifully observed bittersweet comedy written by the great Jack Rosenthal. It properly made me laugh, while providing a really good look at a lower-middle class London Jewish family haphazardly preparing for their son's Bar Mitzvah. The acting and dialogue are basically perfect, and I wasn't at all distracted by the Play for Today functional visuals.""...and don't just lie…"

It is an attempt at an romantic gothic thriller, with a neat circuitous plot device.A pretty young woman lures male victims into boarding house in New Orleans, at the behest of a local warlock, who seemingly wants to relive a love triangle endlessly. It is a good plot, with a good ending.The TV movie has the cheap aesthetic, as all the ""Classic Ghosts"" series does, but I found myself fairly taken with this entry."

He also spends 66 the minutes hooking up with the widowed boarding house owner, a horny Gwen Verdon. There is plenty sexual insinuations (the way they tie the ghost up...) and an oddly vague and unclear supernatural haunting. Probably the best of the Classic Ghosts series that I have watched so far."

It is the highpoint never again to be reached. I guess I found it too twee. Too particular. David Byrne having a bit of fun at the expense of the Texans, though he doesn't go over the top. It is a pleasant film, with lightly quirky touches, but little else. More Northern Exposure than Twin Peaks. I found myself tiring of it before the 90 minute mark.David Byrne has to be the most talented person ever live in Dumbarton."

It is a biography of Wernher von Braun, which cannot decide whether he deserves respect of condemnation.

A slightly silly mystery film, obsessed with the 1990s, about a former precocious tween sleuth who has grown into an underachieving millennial works to solve a murder.
